Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

*****This file should be named 0ddc809a.txt or 0ddc809a.zip*****

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 0ddc810.txt.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 0ddc810a.txt.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Divina Commedia di Dante

by Dante Alighieri

August, 1997  [Etext #1012]


*****The Project Gutenberg Etext "Divina Commedia di Dante"****
*****This file should be named 0ddc809a.txt or 0ddc809a.zip*****

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 0ddc810.txt.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 0ddc810a.txt.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     EITHER:

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     EITHER:

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     EITHER:

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     EITHER:

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till

The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Divina Commedia di Dante

by Dante Alighieri

August, 1997  [Etext #1012]


*****The Project Gutenberg Etext "Divina Commedia di Dante"****
*****This file should be named 0ddc809a.txt or 0ddc809a.zip*****

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 0ddc810.txt.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 0ddc810a.txt.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value

This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-
Mellon University).

Divina Commedia di Dante

by Dante Alighieri

August, 1997  [Etext #1012]


*****The Project Gutenberg Etext "Divina Commedia di Dante"****
**
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     EITHER:

The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at

preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment

in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

*****This file should be named 0ddc809a.txt or 0ddc809a.zip*****

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 0ddc810.txt.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 0ddc810a.txt.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-
Mellon University).

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     EITHER:

     [] ]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the
     net profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Association/Carnegie-Mellon
     University" within the 60 days following each
     date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)
     your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Divina Commedia di Dante

by Dante Alighieri

August, 1997  [Etext #1012]


*****The Project Gutenberg Etext "Divina Commedia di Dante"****
*****This file should be named 0ddc809a.txt or 0ddc809a.zip*****

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 0ddc810.txt.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 0ddc810a.txt.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-
Mellon University).

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     EITHER:

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till

The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment

up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-

Divina Commedia di Dante

by Dante Alighieri

August, 1997  [Etext #1012]


*****The Project Gutenberg Etext "Divina Commedia di Dante"****
**
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment

in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     EITHER:

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Divina Commedia di Dante

by Dante Alighieri

August, 1997  [Etext #1012]


*****The Project Gutenberg Etext "Divina Commedia di Dante"****
*****This file should be named 0ddc809a.txt or 0ddc809a.zip*****

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 0ddc810.txt.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 0ddc810a.txt.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Divina Commedia di Dante

by Dante Alighieri

August, 1997  [Etext #1012]


*****The Project Gutenberg Etext "Divina Commedia di Dante"****
*****This file should be named 0ddc809a.txt or 0ddc809a.zip*****

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 0ddc810.txt.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 0ddc810a.txt.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     EITHER:

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2

which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001

**
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     EITHER:

     [] ]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the
     net profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Association/Carnegie-Mellon
     University" within the 60 days following each
     date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)
     your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Divina Commedia di Dante

by Dante Alighieri

August, 1997  [Etext #1012]


*****The Project Gutenberg Etext "Divina Commedia di Dante"****
*****This file should be named 0ddc809a.txt or 0ddc809a.zip*****

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 0ddc810.txt.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 0ddc810a.txt.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as

Dante's Divine Comedy marks the 1,000th Project Gutenberg Etext.
We will be presenting this work in a wide variety of formats, in
both English and Italian, and in translation by Longfellow, Cary
and possibly more, to include HTML and/or the Italian accents.

WE WOULD ***LOVE*** YOUR ASSISTANCE IN PROOFREADING THESE FILES!

Right now we mostly need help with the Italian and Longfellow, I
think we may have enough proofers for a first run at the Cary.

We hope to have a decent versions of each one by August 31, 1997

LA DIVINA COMMEDIA
di Dante Alighieri





INFERNO




Inferno Â· Canto I


Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita
mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,
chÃ© la diritta via era smarrita.

Ahi quanto a dir qual era Ã¨ cosa dura
esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte
che nel pensier rinova la paura!

Tantâ Ã¨ amara che poco Ã¨ piÃ¹ morte;
ma per trattar del ben châiâ vi trovai,
dirÃ² de lâaltre cose châiâ vâho scorte.

Io non so ben ridir comâ iâ vâintrai,
tantâ era pien di sonno a quel punto
che la verace via abbandonai.

Ma poi châiâ fui al piÃ¨ dâun colle giunto,
lÃ  dove terminava quella valle
che mâavea di paura il cor compunto,

guardai in alto e vidi le sue spalle
vestite giÃ  deâ raggi del pianeta
che mena dritto altrui per ogne calle.

Allor fu la paura un poco queta,
che nel lago del cor mâera durata
la notte châiâ passai con tanta pieta.

E come quei che con lena affannata,
uscito fuor del pelago a la riva,
si volge a lâacqua perigliosa e guata,

cosÃ¬ lâanimo mio, châancor fuggiva,
si volse a retro a rimirar lo passo
che non lasciÃ² giÃ  mai persona viva.

Poi châÃ¨i posato un poco il corpo lasso,
ripresi via per la piaggia diserta,
sÃ¬ che âl piÃ¨ fermo sempre era âl piÃ¹ basso.

Ed ecco, quasi al cominciar de lâerta,
una lonza leggera e presta molto,
che di pel macolato era coverta;

e non mi si partia dinanzi al volto,
anzi âmpediva tanto il mio cammino,
châiâ fui per ritornar piÃ¹ volte vÃ²lto.

Tempâ era dal principio del mattino,
e âl sol montava ân sÃ¹ con quelle stelle
châeran con lui quando lâamor divino

mosse di prima quelle cose belle;
sÃ¬ châa bene sperar mâera cagione
di quella fiera a la gaetta pelle

lâora del tempo e la dolce stagione;
ma non sÃ¬ che paura non mi desse
la vista che mâapparve dâun leone.

Questi parea che contra me venisse
con la testâ alta e con rabbiosa fame,
sÃ¬ che parea che lâaere ne tremesse.

Ed una lupa, che di tutte brame
sembiava carca ne la sua magrezza,
e molte genti fÃ© giÃ  viver grame,

questa mi porse tanto di gravezza
con la paura châuscia di sua vista,
châio perdei la speranza de lâaltezza.

E qual Ã¨ quei che volontieri acquista,
e giugne âl tempo che perder lo face,
che ân tutti suoi pensier piange e sâattrista;

tal mi fece la bestia sanza pace,
che, venendomi âncontro, a poco a poco
mi ripigneva lÃ  dove âl sol tace.

Mentre châiâ rovinava in basso loco,
dinanzi a li occhi mi si fu offerto
chi per lungo silenzio parea fioco.

Quando vidi costui nel gran diserto,
Â«Miserere di meÂ», gridai a lui,
Â«qual che tu sii, od ombra od omo certo!Â».

Rispuosemi: Â«Non omo, omo giÃ  fui,
e li parenti miei furon lombardi,
mantoani per patrÃ¯a ambedui.

Nacqui sub Iulio, ancor che fosse tardi,
e vissi a Roma sotto âl buono Augusto
nel tempo de li dÃ¨i falsi e bugiardi.

Poeta fui, e cantai di quel giusto
figliuol dâAnchise che venne di Troia,
poi che âl superbo IlÃ¯Ã³n fu combusto.

Ma tu perchÃ© ritorni a tanta noia?
perchÃ© non sali il dilettoso monte
châÃ¨ principio e cagion di tutta gioia?Â».

Â«Or seâ tu quel Virgilio e quella fonte
che spandi di parlar sÃ¬ largo fiume?Â»,
rispuosâ io lui con vergognosa fronte.

Â«O de li altri poeti onore e lume,
vagliami âl lungo studio e âl grande amore
che mâha fatto cercar lo tuo volume.

Tu seâ lo mio maestro e âl mio autore,
tu seâ solo colui da cuâ io tolsi
lo bello stilo che mâha fatto onore.

Vedi la bestia per cuâ io mi volsi;
aiutami da lei, famoso saggio,
châella mi fa tremar le vene e i polsiÂ».

Â«A te convien tenere altro vÃ¯aggioÂ»,
rispuose, poi che lagrimar mi vide,
Â«se vuoâ campar dâesto loco selvaggio;

chÃ© questa bestia, per la qual tu gride,
non lascia altrui passar per la sua via,
ma tanto lo âmpedisce che lâuccide;

e ha natura sÃ¬ malvagia e ria,
che mai non empie la bramosa voglia,
e dopo âl pasto ha piÃ¹ fame che pria.

Molti son li animali a cui sâammoglia,
e piÃ¹ saranno ancora, infin che âl veltro
verrÃ , che la farÃ  morir con doglia.

Questi non ciberÃ  terra nÃ© peltro,
ma sapÃ¯enza, amore e virtute,
e sua nazion sarÃ  tra feltro e feltro.

Di quella umile Italia fia salute
per cui morÃ¬ la vergine Cammilla,
Eurialo e Turno e Niso di ferute.

Questi la caccerÃ  per ogne villa,
fin che lâavrÃ  rimessa ne lo ânferno,
lÃ  onde ânvidia prima dipartilla.

Ondâ io per lo tuo meâ penso e discerno
che tu mi segui, e io sarÃ² tua guida,
e trarrotti di qui per loco etterno;

ove udirai le disperate strida,
vedrai li antichi spiriti dolenti,
châa la seconda morte ciascun grida;

e vederai color che son contenti
nel foco, perchÃ© speran di venire
quando che sia a le beate genti.

A le quai poi se tu vorrai salire,
anima fia a ciÃ² piÃ¹ di me degna:
con lei ti lascerÃ² nel mio partire;

chÃ© quello imperador che lÃ  sÃ¹ regna,
perchâ iâ fuâ ribellante a la sua legge,
non vuol che ân sua cittÃ  per me si vegna.

In tutte parti impera e quivi regge;
quivi Ã¨ la sua cittÃ  e lâalto seggio:
oh felice colui cuâ ivi elegge!Â».

E io a lui: Â«Poeta, io ti richeggio
per quello Dio che tu non conoscesti,
acciÃ² châio fugga questo male e peggio,

che tu mi meni lÃ  dovâ or dicesti,
sÃ¬ châio veggia la porta di san Pietro
e color cui tu fai cotanto mestiÂ».

Allor si mosse, e io li tenni dietro.



Inferno Â· Canto II


Lo giorno se nâandava, e lâaere bruno
toglieva li animai che sono in terra
da le fatiche loro; e io sol uno

mâapparecchiava a sostener la guerra
sÃ¬ del cammino e sÃ¬ de la pietate,
che ritrarrÃ  la mente che non erra.

O muse, o alto ingegno, or mâaiutate;
o mente che scrivesti ciÃ² châio vidi,
qui si parrÃ  la tua nobilitate.

Io cominciai: Â«Poeta che mi guidi,
guarda la mia virtÃ¹ sâellâ Ã¨ possente,
prima châa lâalto passo tu mi fidi.

Tu dici che di SilvÃ¯o il parente,
corruttibile ancora, ad immortale
secolo andÃ², e fu sensibilmente.

PerÃ², se lâavversario dâogne male
cortese i fu, pensando lâalto effetto
châuscir dovea di lui, e âl chi e âl quale

non pare indegno ad omo dâintelletto;
châeâ fu de lâalma Roma e di suo impero
ne lâempireo ciel per padre eletto:

la quale e âl quale, a voler dir lo vero,
fu stabilita per lo loco santo
uâ siede il successor del maggior Piero.

Per questâ andata onde li dai tu vanto,
intese cose che furon cagione
di sua vittoria e del papale ammanto.

Andovvi poi lo Vas dâelezÃ¯one,
per recarne conforto a quella fede
châÃ¨ principio a la via di salvazione.

Ma io, perchÃ© venirvi? o chi âl concede?
Io non EnÃ«a, io non Paulo sono;
me degno a ciÃ² nÃ© io nÃ© altri âl crede.

Per che, se del venire io mâabbandono,
temo che la venuta non sia folle.
Seâ savio; intendi meâ châiâ non ragionoÂ».

E qual Ã¨ quei che disvuol ciÃ² che volle
e per novi pensier cangia proposta,
sÃ¬ che dal cominciar tutto si tolle,

tal mi fecâ Ã¯o ân quella oscura costa,
perchÃ©, pensando, consumai la âmpresa
che fu nel cominciar cotanto tosta.

Â«Sâiâ ho ben la parola tua intesaÂ»,
rispuose del magnanimo quellâ ombra,
Â«lâanima tua Ã¨ da viltade offesa;

la qual molte fÃ¯ate lâomo ingombra
sÃ¬ che dâonrata impresa lo rivolve,
come falso veder bestia quandâ ombra.

Da questa tema acciÃ² che tu ti solve,
dirotti perchâ io venni e quel châio ântesi
nel primo punto che di te mi dolve.

Io era tra color che son sospesi,
e donna mi chiamÃ² beata e bella,
tal che di comandare io la richiesi.

Lucevan li occhi suoi piÃ¹ che la stella;
e cominciommi a dir soave e piana,
con angelica voce, in sua favella:

âO anima cortese mantoana,
di cui la fama ancor nel mondo dura,
e durerÃ  quanto âl mondo lontana,

lâamico mio, e non de la ventura,
ne la diserta piaggia Ã¨ impedito
sÃ¬ nel cammin, che vÃ²ltâ Ã¨ per paura;

e temo che non sia giÃ  sÃ¬ smarrito,
châio mi sia tardi al soccorso levata,
per quel châiâ ho di lui nel cielo udito.

Or movi, e con la tua parola ornata
e con ciÃ² câha mestieri al suo campare,
lâaiuta sÃ¬ châiâ ne sia consolata.

Iâ son Beatrice che ti faccio andare;
vegno del loco ove tornar disio;
amor mi mosse, che mi fa parlare.

Quando sarÃ² dinanzi al segnor mio,
di te mi loderÃ² sovente a luiâ.
Tacette allora, e poi cominciaâ io:

âO donna di virtÃ¹ sola per cui
lâumana spezie eccede ogne contento
di quel ciel câha minor li cerchi sui,

tanto mâaggrada il tuo comandamento,
che lâubidir, se giÃ  fosse, mâÃ¨ tardi;
piÃ¹ non tâÃ¨ uoâ châaprirmi il tuo talento.

Ma dimmi la cagion che non ti guardi
de lo scender qua giuso in questo centro
de lâampio loco ove tornar tu ardiâ.

âDa che tu vuoâ saver cotanto a dentro,
dirotti brievementeâ, mi rispuose,
âperchâ iâ non temo di venir qua entro.

Temer si dee di sole quelle cose
câhanno potenza di fare altrui male;
de lâaltre no, chÃ© non son paurose.

Iâ son fatta da Dio, sua mercÃ©, tale,
che la vostra miseria non mi tange,
nÃ© fiamma dâesto âncendio non mâassale.

Donna Ã¨ gentil nel ciel che si compiange
di questo âmpedimento ovâ io ti mando,
sÃ¬ che duro giudicio lÃ  sÃ¹ frange.

Questa chiese Lucia in suo dimando
e disse:âOr ha bisogno il tuo fedele
di te, e io a te lo raccomandoâ.

Lucia, nimica di ciascun crudele,
si mosse, e venne al loco dovâ iâ era,
che mi sedea con lâantica Rachele.

Disse:âBeatrice, loda di Dio vera,
chÃ© non soccorri quei che tâamÃ² tanto,
châuscÃ¬ per te de la volgare schiera?

Non odi tu la pieta del suo pianto,
non vedi tu la morte che âl combatte
su la fiumana ove âl mar non ha vanto?â.

Al mondo non fur mai persone ratte
a far lor pro o a fuggir lor danno,
comâ io, dopo cotai parole fatte,

venni qua giÃ¹ del mio beato scanno,
fidandomi del tuo parlare onesto,
châonora te e quei châudito lâhannoâ.

Poscia che mâebbe ragionato questo,
li occhi lucenti lagrimando volse,
per che mi fece del venir piÃ¹ presto.

E venni a te cosÃ¬ comâ ella volse:
dâinanzi a quella fiera ti levai
che del bel monte il corto andar ti tolse.

Dunque: che Ã¨? perchÃ©, perchÃ© restai,
perchÃ© tanta viltÃ  nel core allette,
perchÃ© ardire e franchezza non hai,

poscia che tai tre donne benedette
curan di te ne la corte del cielo,
e âl mio parlar tanto ben ti promette?Â».

Quali fioretti dal notturno gelo
chinati e chiusi, poi che âl sol li âmbianca,
si drizzan tutti aperti in loro stelo,

tal mi fecâ io di mia virtude stanca,
e tanto buono ardire al cor mi corse,
châiâ cominciai come persona franca:

Â«Oh pietosa colei che mi soccorse!
e te cortese châubidisti tosto
a le vere parole che ti porse!

Tu mâhai con disiderio il cor disposto
sÃ¬ al venir con le parole tue,
châiâ son tornato nel primo proposto.

Or va, châun sol volere Ã¨ dâambedue:
tu duca, tu segnore e tu maestroÂ».
CosÃ¬ li dissi; e poi che mosso fue,

intrai per lo cammino alto e silvestro.



Inferno Â· Canto III


âPer me si va ne la cittÃ  dolente,
per me si va ne lâetterno dolore,
per me si va tra la perduta gente.

Giustizia mosse il mio alto fattore;
fecemi la divina podestate,
la somma sapÃ¯enza e âl primo amore.

Dinanzi a me non fuor cose create
se non etterne, e io etterno duro.
Lasciate ogne speranza, voi châintrateâ.

Queste parole di colore oscuro
vidâ Ã¯o scritte al sommo dâuna porta;
per châio: Â«Maestro, il senso lor mâÃ¨ duroÂ».

Ed elli a me, come persona accorta:
Â«Qui si convien lasciare ogne sospetto;
ogne viltÃ  convien che qui sia morta.

Noi siam venuti al loco ovâ iâ tâho detto
che tu vedrai le genti dolorose
câhanno perduto il ben de lâintellettoÂ».

E poi che la sua mano a la mia puose
con lieto volto, ondâ io mi confortai,
mi mise dentro a le segrete cose.

Quivi sospiri, pianti e alti guai
risonavan per lâaere sanza stelle,
per châio al cominciar ne lagrimai.

Diverse lingue, orribili favelle,
parole di dolore, accenti dâira,
voci alte e fioche, e suon di man con elle

facevano un tumulto, il qual sâaggira
sempre in quellâ aura sanza tempo tinta,
come la rena quando turbo spira.

E io châavea dâerror la testa cinta,
dissi: Â«Maestro, che Ã¨ quel châiâ odo?
e che gentâ Ã¨ che par nel duol sÃ¬ vinta?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«Questo misero modo
tegnon lâanime triste di coloro
che visser sanza ânfamia e sanza lodo.

Mischiate sono a quel cattivo coro
de li angeli che non furon ribelli
nÃ© fur fedeli a Dio, ma per sÃ© fuoro.

Caccianli i ciel per non esser men belli,
nÃ© lo profondo inferno li riceve,
châalcuna gloria i rei avrebber dâelliÂ».

E io: Â«Maestro, che Ã¨ tanto greve
a lor che lamentar li fa sÃ¬ forte?Â».
Rispuose: Â«Dicerolti molto breve.

Questi non hanno speranza di morte,
e la lor cieca vita Ã¨ tanto bassa,
che ânvidÃ¯osi son dâogne altra sorte.

Fama di loro il mondo esser non lassa;
misericordia e giustizia li sdegna:
non ragioniam di lor, ma guarda e passaÂ».

E io, che riguardai, vidi una ânsegna
che girando correva tanto ratta,
che dâogne posa mi parea indegna;

e dietro le venÃ¬a sÃ¬ lunga tratta
di gente, châiâ non averei creduto
che morte tanta nâavesse disfatta.

Poscia châio vâebbi alcun riconosciuto,
vidi e conobbi lâombra di colui
che fece per viltade il gran rifiuto.

Incontanente intesi e certo fui
che questa era la setta dâi cattivi,
a Dio spiacenti e aâ nemici sui.

Questi sciaurati, che mai non fur vivi,
erano ignudi e stimolati molto
da mosconi e da vespe châeran ivi.

Elle rigavan lor di sangue il volto,
che, mischiato di lagrime, aâ lor piedi
da fastidiosi vermi era ricolto.

E poi châa riguardar oltre mi diedi,
vidi genti a la riva dâun gran fiume;
per châio dissi: Â«Maestro, or mi concedi

châiâ sappia quali sono, e qual costume
le fa di trapassar parer sÃ¬ pronte,
comâ iâ discerno per lo fioco lumeÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«Le cose ti fier conte
quando noi fermerem li nostri passi
su la trista riviera dâAcheronteÂ».

Allor con li occhi vergognosi e bassi,
temendo no âl mio dir li fosse grave,
infino al fiume del parlar mi trassi.

Ed ecco verso noi venir per nave
un vecchio, bianco per antico pelo,
gridando: Â«Guai a voi, anime prave!

Non isperate mai veder lo cielo:
iâ vegno per menarvi a lâaltra riva
ne le tenebre etterne, in caldo e ân gelo.

E tu che seâ costÃ¬, anima viva,
pÃ rtiti da cotesti che son mortiÂ».
Ma poi che vide châio non mi partiva,

disse: Â«Per altra via, per altri porti
verrai a piaggia, non qui, per passare:
piÃ¹ lieve legno convien che ti portiÂ».

E âl duca lui: Â«Caron, non ti crucciare:
vuolsi cosÃ¬ colÃ  dove si puote
ciÃ² che si vuole, e piÃ¹ non dimandareÂ».

Quinci fuor quete le lanose gote
al nocchier de la livida palude,
che ântorno a li occhi avea di fiamme rote.

Ma quellâ anime, châeran lasse e nude,
cangiar colore e dibattero i denti,
ratto che ânteser le parole crude.

Bestemmiavano Dio e lor parenti,
lâumana spezie e âl loco e âl tempo e âl seme
di lor semenza e di lor nascimenti.

Poi si ritrasser tutte quante insieme,
forte piangendo, a la riva malvagia
châattende ciascun uom che Dio non teme.

Caron dimonio, con occhi di bragia
loro accennando, tutte le raccoglie;
batte col remo qualunque sâadagia.

Come dâautunno si levan le foglie
lâuna appresso de lâaltra, fin che âl ramo
vede a la terra tutte le sue spoglie,

similemente il mal seme dâAdamo
gittansi di quel lito ad una ad una,
per cenni come augel per suo richiamo.

CosÃ¬ sen vanno su per lâonda bruna,
e avanti che sien di lÃ  discese,
anche di qua nuova schiera sâauna.

Â«Figliuol mioÂ», disse âl maestro cortese,
Â«quelli che muoion ne lâira di Dio
tutti convegnon qui dâogne paese;

e pronti sono a trapassar lo rio,
chÃ© la divina giustizia li sprona,
sÃ¬ che la tema si volve in disio.

Quinci non passa mai anima buona;
e perÃ², se Caron di te si lagna,
ben puoi sapere omai che âl suo dir suonaÂ».

Finito questo, la buia campagna
tremÃ² sÃ¬ forte, che de lo spavento
la mente di sudore ancor mi bagna.

La terra lagrimosa diede vento,
che balenÃ² una luce vermiglia
la qual mi vinse ciascun sentimento;

e caddi come lâuom cui sonno piglia.



Inferno Â· Canto IV


Ruppemi lâalto sonno ne la testa
un greve truono, sÃ¬ châio mi riscossi
come persona châÃ¨ per forza desta;

e lâocchio riposato intorno mossi,
dritto levato, e fiso riguardai
per conoscer lo loco dovâ io fossi.

Vero Ã¨ che ân su la proda mi trovai
de la valle dâabisso dolorosa
che ântrono accoglie dâinfiniti guai.

Oscura e profonda era e nebulosa
tanto che, per ficcar lo viso a fondo,
io non vi discernea alcuna cosa.

Â«Or discendiam qua giÃ¹ nel cieco mondoÂ»,
cominciÃ² il poeta tutto smorto.
Â«Io sarÃ² primo, e tu sarai secondoÂ».

E io, che del color mi fui accorto,
dissi: Â«Come verrÃ², se tu paventi
che suoli al mio dubbiare esser conforto?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«Lâangoscia de le genti
che son qua giÃ¹, nel viso mi dipigne
quella pietÃ  che tu per tema senti.

Andiam, chÃ© la via lunga ne sospigneÂ».
CosÃ¬ si mise e cosÃ¬ mi fÃ© intrare
nel primo cerchio che lâabisso cigne.

Quivi, secondo che per ascoltare,
non avea pianto mai che di sospiri
che lâaura etterna facevan tremare;

ciÃ² avvenia di duol sanza martÃ¬ri,
châavean le turbe, châeran molte e grandi,
dâinfanti e di femmine e di viri.

Lo buon maestro a me: Â«Tu non dimandi
che spiriti son questi che tu vedi?
Or voâ che sappi, innanzi che piÃ¹ andi,

châei non peccaro; e sâelli hanno mercedi,
non basta, perchÃ© non ebber battesmo,
châÃ¨ porta de la fede che tu credi;

e sâeâ furon dinanzi al cristianesmo,
non adorar debitamente a Dio:
e di questi cotai son io medesmo.

Per tai difetti, non per altro rio,
semo perduti, e sol di tanto offesi
che sanza speme vivemo in disioÂ».

Gran duol mi prese al cor quando lo ântesi,
perÃ² che gente di molto valore
conobbi che ân quel limbo eran sospesi.

Â«Dimmi, maestro mio, dimmi, segnoreÂ»,
cominciaâ io per voler esser certo
di quella fede che vince ogne errore:

Â«uscicci mai alcuno, o per suo merto
o per altrui, che poi fosse beato?Â».
E quei che ântese il mio parlar coverto,

rispuose: Â«Io era nuovo in questo stato,
quando ci vidi venire un possente,
con segno di vittoria coronato.

Trasseci lâombra del primo parente,
dâAbÃ¨l suo figlio e quella di NoÃ¨,
di MoÃ¯sÃ¨ legista e ubidente;

AbraÃ m patrÃ¯arca e DavÃ¬d re,
IsraÃ¨l con lo padre e coâ suoi nati
e con Rachele, per cui tanto fÃ©,

e altri molti, e feceli beati.
E voâ che sappi che, dinanzi ad essi,
spiriti umani non eran salvatiÂ».

Non lasciavam lâandar perchâ ei dicessi,
ma passavam la selva tuttavia,
la selva, dico, di spiriti spessi.

Non era lunga ancor la nostra via
di qua dal sonno, quandâ io vidi un foco
châemisperio di tenebre vincia.

Di lungi nâeravamo ancora un poco,
ma non sÃ¬ châio non discernessi in parte
châorrevol gente possedea quel loco.

Â«O tu châonori scÃ¯enzÃ¯a e arte,
questi chi son câhanno cotanta onranza,
che dal modo de li altri li diparte?Â».

E quelli a me: Â«Lâonrata nominanza
che di lor suona sÃ¹ ne la tua vita,
grazÃ¯a acquista in ciel che sÃ¬ li avanzaÂ».

Intanto voce fu per me udita:
Â«Onorate lâaltissimo poeta;
lâombra sua torna, châera dipartitaÂ».

Poi che la voce fu restata e queta,
vidi quattro grandâ ombre a noi venire:
sembianzâ avevan nÃ© trista nÃ© lieta.

Lo buon maestro cominciÃ² a dire:
Â«Mira colui con quella spada in mano,
che vien dinanzi ai tre sÃ¬ come sire:

quelli Ã¨ Omero poeta sovrano;
lâaltro Ã¨ Orazio satiro che vene;
Ovidio Ã¨ âl terzo, e lâultimo Lucano.

PerÃ² che ciascun meco si convene
nel nome che sonÃ² la voce sola,
fannomi onore, e di ciÃ² fanno beneÂ».

CosÃ¬ vidâ iâ adunar la bella scola
di quel segnor de lâaltissimo canto
che sovra li altri comâ aquila vola.

Da châebber ragionato insieme alquanto,
volsersi a me con salutevol cenno,
e âl mio maestro sorrise di tanto;

e piÃ¹ dâonore ancora assai mi fenno,
châeâ sÃ¬ mi fecer de la loro schiera,
sÃ¬ châio fui sesto tra cotanto senno.

CosÃ¬ andammo infino a la lumera,
parlando cose che âl tacere Ã¨ bello,
sÃ¬ comâ era âl parlar colÃ  dovâ era.

Venimmo al piÃ¨ dâun nobile castello,
sette volte cerchiato dâalte mura,
difeso intorno dâun bel fiumicello.

Questo passammo come terra dura;
per sette porte intrai con questi savi:
giugnemmo in prato di fresca verdura.

Genti vâeran con occhi tardi e gravi,
di grande autoritÃ  neâ lor sembianti:
parlavan rado, con voci soavi.

Traemmoci cosÃ¬ da lâun deâ canti,
in loco aperto, luminoso e alto,
sÃ¬ che veder si potien tutti quanti.

ColÃ  diritto, sovra âl verde smalto,
mi fuor mostrati li spiriti magni,
che del vedere in me stesso mâessalto.

Iâ vidi Eletra con molti compagni,
tra â quai conobbi EttÃ²r ed Enea,
Cesare armato con li occhi grifagni.

Vidi Cammilla e la Pantasilea;
da lâaltra parte vidi âl re Latino
che con Lavina sua figlia sedea.

Vidi quel Bruto che cacciÃ² Tarquino,
Lucrezia, Iulia, MarzÃ¯a e Corniglia;
e solo, in parte, vidi âl Saladino.

Poi châinnalzai un poco piÃ¹ le ciglia,
vidi âl maestro di color che sanno
seder tra filosofica famiglia.

Tutti lo miran, tutti onor li fanno:
quivi vidâ Ã¯o Socrate e Platone,
che ânnanzi a li altri piÃ¹ presso li stanno;

Democrito che âl mondo a caso pone,
DÃ¯ogenÃ¨s, Anassagora e Tale,
EmpedoclÃ¨s, Eraclito e Zenone;

e vidi il buono accoglitor del quale,
DÃ¯ascoride dico; e vidi Orfeo,
TulÃ¯o e Lino e Seneca morale;

Euclide geomÃ¨tra e Tolomeo,
IpocrÃ te, Avicenna e GalÃ¯eno,
AveroÃ¬s, che âl gran comento feo.

Io non posso ritrar di tutti a pieno,
perÃ² che sÃ¬ mi caccia il lungo tema,
che molte volte al fatto il dir vien meno.

La sesta compagnia in due si scema:
per altra via mi mena il savio duca,
fuor de la queta, ne lâaura che trema.

E vegno in parte ove non Ã¨ che luca.



Inferno Â· Canto V


CosÃ¬ discesi del cerchio primaio
giÃ¹ nel secondo, che men loco cinghia
e tanto piÃ¹ dolor, che punge a guaio.

Stavvi MinÃ²s orribilmente, e ringhia:
essamina le colpe ne lâintrata;
giudica e manda secondo châavvinghia.

Dico che quando lâanima mal nata
li vien dinanzi, tutta si confessa;
e quel conoscitor de le peccata

vede qual loco dâinferno Ã¨ da essa;
cignesi con la coda tante volte
quantunque gradi vuol che giÃ¹ sia messa.

Sempre dinanzi a lui ne stanno molte:
vanno a vicenda ciascuna al giudizio,
dicono e odono e poi son giÃ¹ volte.

Â«O tu che vieni al doloroso ospizioÂ»,
disse MinÃ²s a me quando mi vide,
lasciando lâatto di cotanto offizio,

Â«guarda comâ entri e di cui tu ti fide;
non tâinganni lâampiezza de lâintrare!Â».
E âl duca mio a lui: Â«PerchÃ© pur gride?

Non impedir lo suo fatale andare:
vuolsi cosÃ¬ colÃ  dove si puote
ciÃ² che si vuole, e piÃ¹ non dimandareÂ».

Or incomincian le dolenti note
a farmisi sentire; or son venuto
lÃ  dove molto pianto mi percuote.

Io venni in loco dâogne luce muto,
che mugghia come fa mar per tempesta,
se da contrari venti Ã¨ combattuto.

La bufera infernal, che mai non resta,
mena li spirti con la sua rapina;
voltando e percotendo li molesta.

Quando giungon davanti a la ruina,
quivi le strida, il compianto, il lamento;
bestemmian quivi la virtÃ¹ divina.

Intesi châa cosÃ¬ fatto tormento
enno dannati i peccator carnali,
che la ragion sommettono al talento.

E come li stornei ne portan lâali
nel freddo tempo, a schiera larga e piena,
cosÃ¬ quel fiato li spiriti mali

di qua, di lÃ , di giÃ¹, di sÃ¹ li mena;
nulla speranza li conforta mai,
non che di posa, ma di minor pena.

E come i gru van cantando lor lai,
faccendo in aere di sÃ© lunga riga,
cosÃ¬ vidâ io venir, traendo guai,

ombre portate da la detta briga;
per châiâ dissi: Â«Maestro, chi son quelle
genti che lâaura nera sÃ¬ gastiga?Â».

Â«La prima di color di cui novelle
tu vuoâ saperÂ», mi disse quelli allotta,
Â«fu imperadrice di molte favelle.

A vizio di lussuria fu sÃ¬ rotta,
che libito fÃ© licito in sua legge,
per tÃ²rre il biasmo in che era condotta.

Ellâ Ã¨ SemiramÃ¬s, di cui si legge
che succedette a Nino e fu sua sposa:
tenne la terra che âl Soldan corregge.

Lâaltra Ã¨ colei che sâancise amorosa,
e ruppe fede al cener di Sicheo;
poi Ã¨ CleopatrÃ s lussurÃ¯osa.

Elena vedi, per cui tanto reo
tempo si volse, e vedi âl grande Achille,
che con amore al fine combatteo.

Vedi ParÃ¬s, TristanoÂ»; e piÃ¹ di mille
ombre mostrommi e nominommi a dito,
châamor di nostra vita dipartille.

Poscia châio ebbi âl mio dottore udito
nomar le donne antiche e â cavalieri,
pietÃ  mi giunse, e fui quasi smarrito.

Iâ cominciai: Â«Poeta, volontieri
parlerei a quei due che ânsieme vanno,
e paion sÃ¬ al vento esser leggeriÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«Vedrai quando saranno
piÃ¹ presso a noi; e tu allor li priega
per quello amor che i mena, ed ei verrannoÂ».

SÃ¬ tosto come il vento a noi li piega,
mossi la voce: Â«O anime affannate,
venite a noi parlar, sâaltri nol niega!Â».

Quali colombe dal disio chiamate
con lâali alzate e ferme al dolce nido
vegnon per lâaere, dal voler portate;

cotali uscir de la schiera ovâ Ã¨ Dido,
a noi venendo per lâaere maligno,
sÃ¬ forte fu lâaffettÃ¼oso grido.

Â«O animal grazÃ¯oso e benigno
che visitando vai per lâaere perso
noi che tignemmo il mondo di sanguigno,

se fosse amico il re de lâuniverso,
noi pregheremmo lui de la tua pace,
poi câhai pietÃ  del nostro mal perverso.

Di quel che udire e che parlar vi piace,
noi udiremo e parleremo a voi,
mentre che âl vento, come fa, ci tace.

Siede la terra dove nata fui
su la marina dove âl Po discende
per aver pace coâ seguaci sui.

Amor, châal cor gentil ratto sâapprende,
prese costui de la bella persona
che mi fu tolta; e âl modo ancor mâoffende.

Amor, châa nullo amato amar perdona,
mi prese del costui piacer sÃ¬ forte,
che, come vedi, ancor non mâabbandona.

Amor condusse noi ad una morte.
Caina attende chi a vita ci spenseÂ».
Queste parole da lor ci fuor porte.

Quandâ io intesi quellâ anime offense,
chinaâ il viso, e tanto il tenni basso,
fin che âl poeta mi disse: Â«Che pense?Â».

Quando rispuosi, cominciai: Â«Oh lasso,
quanti dolci pensier, quanto disio
menÃ² costoro al doloroso passo!Â».

Poi mi rivolsi a loro e parlaâ io,
e cominciai: Â«Francesca, i tuoi martÃ¬ri
a lagrimar mi fanno tristo e pio.

Ma dimmi: al tempo dâi dolci sospiri,
a che e come concedette amore
che conosceste i dubbiosi disiri?Â».

E quella a me: Â«Nessun maggior dolore
che ricordarsi del tempo felice
ne la miseria; e ciÃ² sa âl tuo dottore.

Ma sâa conoscer la prima radice
del nostro amor tu hai cotanto affetto,
dirÃ² come colui che piange e dice.

Noi leggiavamo un giorno per diletto
di Lancialotto come amor lo strinse;
soli eravamo e sanza alcun sospetto.

Per piÃ¹ fÃ¯ate li occhi ci sospinse
quella lettura, e scolorocci il viso;
ma solo un punto fu quel che ci vinse.

Quando leggemmo il disÃ¯ato riso
esser basciato da cotanto amante,
questi, che mai da me non fia diviso,

la bocca mi basciÃ² tutto tremante.
Galeotto fu âl libro e chi lo scrisse:
quel giorno piÃ¹ non vi leggemmo avanteÂ».

Mentre che lâuno spirto questo disse,
lâaltro piangÃ«a; sÃ¬ che di pietade
io venni men cosÃ¬ comâ io morisse.

E caddi come corpo morto cade.



Inferno Â· Canto VI


Al tornar de la mente, che si chiuse
dinanzi a la pietÃ  dâi due cognati,
che di trestizia tutto mi confuse,

novi tormenti e novi tormentati
mi veggio intorno, come châio mi mova
e châio mi volga, e come che io guati.

Io sono al terzo cerchio, de la piova
etterna, maladetta, fredda e greve;
regola e qualitÃ  mai non lâÃ¨ nova.

Grandine grossa, acqua tinta e neve
per lâaere tenebroso si riversa;
pute la terra che questo riceve.

Cerbero, fiera crudele e diversa,
con tre gole caninamente latra
sovra la gente che quivi Ã¨ sommersa.

Li occhi ha vermigli, la barba unta e atra,
e âl ventre largo, e unghiate le mani;
graffia li spirti ed iscoia ed isquatra.

Urlar li fa la pioggia come cani;
de lâun deâ lati fanno a lâaltro schermo;
volgonsi spesso i miseri profani.

Quando ci scorse Cerbero, il gran vermo,
le bocche aperse e mostrocci le sanne;
non avea membro che tenesse fermo.

E âl duca mio distese le sue spanne,
prese la terra, e con piene le pugna
la gittÃ² dentro a le bramose canne.

Qual Ã¨ quel cane châabbaiando agogna,
e si racqueta poi che âl pasto morde,
chÃ© solo a divorarlo intende e pugna,

cotai si fecer quelle facce lorde
de lo demonio Cerbero, che ântrona
lâanime sÃ¬, châesser vorrebber sorde.

Noi passavam su per lâombre che adona
la greve pioggia, e ponavam le piante
sovra lor vanitÃ  che par persona.

Elle giacean per terra tutte quante,
fuor dâuna châa seder si levÃ², ratto
châella ci vide passarsi davante.

Â«O tu che seâ per questo ânferno trattoÂ»,
mi disse, Â«riconoscimi, se sai:
tu fosti, prima châio disfatto, fattoÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Lâangoscia che tu hai
forse ti tira fuor de la mia mente,
sÃ¬ che non par châiâ ti vedessi mai.

Ma dimmi chi tu seâ che ân sÃ¬ dolente
loco seâ messo, e hai sÃ¬ fatta pena,
che, sâaltra Ã¨ maggio, nulla Ã¨ sÃ¬ spiacenteÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«La tua cittÃ , châÃ¨ piena
dâinvidia sÃ¬ che giÃ  trabocca il sacco,
seco mi tenne in la vita serena.

Voi cittadini mi chiamaste Ciacco:
per la dannosa colpa de la gola,
come tu vedi, a la pioggia mi fiacco.

E io anima trista non son sola,
chÃ© tutte queste a simil pena stanno
per simil colpaÂ». E piÃ¹ non fÃ© parola.

Io li rispuosi: Â«Ciacco, il tuo affanno
mi pesa sÃ¬, châa lagrimar mi ânvita;
ma dimmi, se tu sai, a che verranno

li cittadin de la cittÃ  partita;
sâalcun vâÃ¨ giusto; e dimmi la cagione
per che lâha tanta discordia assalitaÂ».

E quelli a me: Â«Dopo lunga tencione
verranno al sangue, e la parte selvaggia
caccerÃ  lâaltra con molta offensione.

Poi appresso convien che questa caggia
infra tre soli, e che lâaltra sormonti
con la forza di tal che testÃ© piaggia.

Alte terrÃ  lungo tempo le fronti,
tenendo lâaltra sotto gravi pesi,
come che di ciÃ² pianga o che nâaonti.

Giusti son due, e non vi sono intesi;
superbia, invidia e avarizia sono
le tre faville câhanno i cuori accesiÂ».

Qui puose fine al lagrimabil suono.
E io a lui: Â«Ancor voâ che mi ânsegni
e che di piÃ¹ parlar mi facci dono.

Farinata e âl Tegghiaio, che fuor sÃ¬ degni,
Iacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo e âl Mosca
e li altri châa ben far puoser li ângegni,

dimmi ove sono e fa châio li conosca;
chÃ© gran disio mi stringe di savere
se âl ciel li addolcia o lo ânferno li attoscaÂ».

E quelli: Â«Ei son tra lâanime piÃ¹ nere;
diverse colpe giÃ¹ li grava al fondo:
se tanto scendi, lÃ  i potrai vedere.

Ma quando tu sarai nel dolce mondo,
priegoti châa la mente altrui mi rechi:
piÃ¹ non ti dico e piÃ¹ non ti rispondoÂ».

Li diritti occhi torse allora in biechi;
guardommi un poco e poi chinÃ² la testa:
cadde con essa a par de li altri ciechi.

E âl duca disse a me: Â«PiÃ¹ non si desta
di qua dal suon de lâangelica tromba,
quando verrÃ  la nimica podesta:

ciascun rivederÃ  la trista tomba,
ripiglierÃ  sua carne e sua figura,
udirÃ  quel châin etterno rimbombaÂ».

SÃ¬ trapassammo per sozza mistura
de lâombre e de la pioggia, a passi lenti,
toccando un poco la vita futura;

per châio dissi: Â«Maestro, esti tormenti
crescerannâ ei dopo la gran sentenza,
o fier minori, o saran sÃ¬ cocenti?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«Ritorna a tua scÃ¯enza,
che vuol, quanto la cosa Ã¨ piÃ¹ perfetta,
piÃ¹ senta il bene, e cosÃ¬ la doglienza.

Tutto che questa gente maladetta
in vera perfezion giÃ  mai non vada,
di lÃ  piÃ¹ che di qua essere aspettaÂ».

Noi aggirammo a tondo quella strada,
parlando piÃ¹ assai châiâ non ridico;
venimmo al punto dove si digrada:

quivi trovammo Pluto, il gran nemico.



Inferno Â· Canto VII


Â«Pape SatÃ n, pape SatÃ n aleppe!Â»,
cominciÃ² Pluto con la voce chioccia;
e quel savio gentil, che tutto seppe,

disse per confortarmi: Â«Non ti noccia
la tua paura; chÃ©, poder châelli abbia,
non ci torrÃ  lo scender questa rocciaÂ».

Poi si rivolse a quella ânfiata labbia,
e disse: Â«Taci, maladetto lupo!
consuma dentro te con la tua rabbia.

Non Ã¨ sanza cagion lâandare al cupo:
vuolsi ne lâalto, lÃ  dove Michele
fÃ© la vendetta del superbo strupoÂ».

Quali dal vento le gonfiate vele
caggiono avvolte, poi che lâalber fiacca,
tal cadde a terra la fiera crudele.

CosÃ¬ scendemmo ne la quarta lacca,
pigliando piÃ¹ de la dolente ripa
che âl mal de lâuniverso tutto insacca.

Ahi giustizia di Dio! tante chi stipa
nove travaglie e pene quantâ io viddi?
e perchÃ© nostra colpa sÃ¬ ne scipa?

Come fa lâonda lÃ  sovra Cariddi,
che si frange con quella in cui sâintoppa,
cosÃ¬ convien che qui la gente riddi.

Qui vidâ iâ gente piÃ¹ châaltrove troppa,
e dâuna parte e dâaltra, con grandâ urli,
voltando pesi per forza di poppa.

PercotÃ«ansi âncontro; e poscia pur lÃ¬
si rivolgea ciascun, voltando a retro,
gridando: Â«PerchÃ© tieni?Â» e Â«PerchÃ© burli?Â».

CosÃ¬ tornavan per lo cerchio tetro
da ogne mano a lâopposito punto,
gridandosi anche loro ontoso metro;

poi si volgea ciascun, quandâ era giunto,
per lo suo mezzo cerchio a lâaltra giostra.
E io, châavea lo cor quasi compunto,

dissi: Â«Maestro mio, or mi dimostra
che gente Ã¨ questa, e se tutti fuor cherci
questi chercuti a la sinistra nostraÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«Tutti quanti fuor guerci
sÃ¬ de la mente in la vita primaia,
che con misura nullo spendio ferci.

Assai la voce lor chiaro lâabbaia,
quando vegnono aâ due punti del cerchio
dove colpa contraria li dispaia.

Questi fuor cherci, che non han coperchio
piloso al capo, e papi e cardinali,
in cui usa avarizia il suo soperchioÂ».

E io: Â«Maestro, tra questi cotali
dovreâ io ben riconoscere alcuni
che furo immondi di cotesti maliÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«Vano pensiero aduni:
la sconoscente vita che i fÃ© sozzi,
ad ogne conoscenza or li fa bruni.

In etterno verranno a li due cozzi:
questi resurgeranno del sepulcro
col pugno chiuso, e questi coi crin mozzi.

Mal dare e mal tener lo mondo pulcro
ha tolto loro, e posti a questa zuffa:
qual ella sia, parole non ci appulcro.

Or puoi, figliuol, veder la corta buffa
dâi ben che son commessi a la fortuna,
per che lâumana gente si rabbuffa;

chÃ© tutto lâoro châÃ¨ sotto la luna
e che giÃ  fu, di questâ anime stanche
non poterebbe farne posare unaÂ».

Â«Maestro mioÂ», dissâ io, Â«or mi dÃ¬ anche:
questa fortuna di che tu mi tocche,
che Ã¨, che i ben del mondo ha sÃ¬ tra branche?Â».

E quelli a me: Â«Oh creature sciocche,
quanta ignoranza Ã¨ quella che vâoffende!
Or voâ che tu mia sentenza ne âmbocche.

Colui lo cui saver tutto trascende,
fece li cieli e diÃ¨ lor chi conduce
sÃ¬, châogne parte ad ogne parte splende,

distribuendo igualmente la luce.
Similemente a li splendor mondani
ordinÃ² general ministra e duce

che permutasse a tempo li ben vani
di gente in gente e dâuno in altro sangue,
oltre la difension dâi senni umani;

per châuna gente impera e lâaltra langue,
seguendo lo giudicio di costei,
che Ã¨ occulto come in erba lâangue.

Vostro saver non ha contasto a lei:
questa provede, giudica, e persegue
suo regno come il loro li altri dÃ¨i.

Le sue permutazion non hanno triegue:
necessitÃ  la fa esser veloce;
sÃ¬ spesso vien chi vicenda consegue.

Questâ Ã¨ colei châÃ¨ tanto posta in croce
pur da color che le dovrien dar lode,
dandole biasmo a torto e mala voce;

ma ella sâÃ¨ beata e ciÃ² non ode:
con lâaltre prime creature lieta
volve sua spera e beata si gode.

Or discendiamo omai a maggior pieta;
giÃ  ogne stella cade che saliva
quandâ io mi mossi, e âl troppo star si vietaÂ».

Noi ricidemmo il cerchio a lâaltra riva
sovrâ una fonte che bolle e riversa
per un fossato che da lei deriva.

Lâacqua era buia assai piÃ¹ che persa;
e noi, in compagnia de lâonde bige,
intrammo giÃ¹ per una via diversa.

In la palude va câha nome Stige
questo tristo ruscel, quandâ Ã¨ disceso
al piÃ¨ de le maligne piagge grige.

E io, che di mirare stava inteso,
vidi genti fangose in quel pantano,
ignude tutte, con sembiante offeso.

Queste si percotean non pur con mano,
ma con la testa e col petto e coi piedi,
troncandosi coâ denti a brano a brano.

Lo buon maestro disse: Â«Figlio, or vedi
lâanime di color cui vinse lâira;
e anche voâ che tu per certo credi

che sotto lâacqua Ã¨ gente che sospira,
e fanno pullular questâ acqua al summo,
come lâocchio ti dice, uâ che sâaggira.

Fitti nel limo dicon: âTristi fummo
ne lâaere dolce che dal sol sâallegra,
portando dentro accidÃ¯oso fummo:

or ci attristiam ne la belletta negraâ.
Questâ inno si gorgoglian ne la strozza,
chÃ© dir nol posson con parola integraÂ».

CosÃ¬ girammo de la lorda pozza
grandâ arco tra la ripa secca e âl mÃ©zzo,
con li occhi vÃ²lti a chi del fango ingozza.

Venimmo al piÃ¨ dâuna torre al da sezzo.



Inferno Â· Canto VIII


Io dico, seguitando, châassai prima
che noi fossimo al piÃ¨ de lâalta torre,
li occhi nostri nâandar suso a la cima

per due fiammette che i vedemmo porre,
e unâaltra da lungi render cenno,
tanto châa pena il potea lâocchio tÃ²rre.

E io mi volsi al mar di tutto âl senno;
dissi: Â«Questo che dice? e che risponde
quellâ altro foco? e chi son quei che âl fenno?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«Su per le sucide onde
giÃ  scorgere puoi quello che sâaspetta,
se âl fummo del pantan nol ti nascondeÂ».

Corda non pinse mai da sÃ© saetta
che sÃ¬ corresse via per lâaere snella,
comâ io vidi una nave piccioletta

venir per lâacqua verso noi in quella,
sotto âl governo dâun sol galeoto,
che gridava: Â«Or seâ giunta, anima fella!Â».

Â«FlegÃ¯Ã s, FlegÃ¯Ã s, tu gridi a vÃ²toÂ»,
disse lo mio segnore, Â«a questa volta:
piÃ¹ non ci avrai che sol passando il lotoÂ».

Qual Ã¨ colui che grande inganno ascolta
che li sia fatto, e poi se ne rammarca,
fecesi FlegÃ¯Ã s ne lâira accolta.

Lo duca mio discese ne la barca,
e poi mi fece intrare appresso lui;
e sol quandâ io fui dentro parve carca.

Tosto che âl duca e io nel legno fui,
segando se ne va lâantica prora
de lâacqua piÃ¹ che non suol con altrui.

Mentre noi corravam la morta gora,
dinanzi mi si fece un pien di fango,
e disse: Â«Chi seâ tu che vieni anzi ora?Â».

E io a lui: Â«Sâiâ vegno, non rimango;
ma tu chi seâ, che sÃ¬ seâ fatto brutto?Â».
Rispuose: Â«Vedi che son un che piangoÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Con piangere e con lutto,
spirito maladetto, ti rimani;
châiâ ti conosco, ancor sie lordo tuttoÂ».

Allor distese al legno ambo le mani;
per che âl maestro accorto lo sospinse,
dicendo: Â«Via costÃ  con li altri cani!Â».

Lo collo poi con le braccia mi cinse;
basciommi âl volto e disse: Â«Alma sdegnosa,
benedetta colei che ân te sâincinse!

Quei fu al mondo persona orgogliosa;
bontÃ  non Ã¨ che sua memoria fregi:
cosÃ¬ sâÃ¨ lâombra sua qui furÃ¯osa.

Quanti si tegnon or lÃ  sÃ¹ gran regi
che qui staranno come porci in brago,
di sÃ© lasciando orribili dispregi!Â».

E io: Â«Maestro, molto sarei vago
di vederlo attuffare in questa broda
prima che noi uscissimo del lagoÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«Avante che la proda
ti si lasci veder, tu sarai sazio:
di tal disÃ¯o convien che tu godaÂ».

Dopo ciÃ² poco vidâ io quello strazio
far di costui a le fangose genti,
che Dio ancor ne lodo e ne ringrazio.

Tutti gridavano: Â«A Filippo Argenti!Â»;
e âl fiorentino spirito bizzarro
in sÃ© medesmo si volvea coâ denti.

Quivi il lasciammo, che piÃ¹ non ne narro;
ma ne lâorecchie mi percosse un duolo,
per châio avante lâocchio intento sbarro.

Lo buon maestro disse: Â«Omai, figliuolo,
sâappressa la cittÃ  câha nome Dite,
coi gravi cittadin, col grande stuoloÂ».

E io: Â«Maestro, giÃ  le sue meschite
lÃ  entro certe ne la valle cerno,
vermiglie come se di foco uscite

fosseroÂ». Ed ei mi disse: Â«Il foco etterno
châentro lâaffoca le dimostra rosse,
come tu vedi in questo basso infernoÂ».

Noi pur giugnemmo dentro a lâalte fosse
che vallan quella terra sconsolata:
le mura mi parean che ferro fosse.

Non sanza prima far grande aggirata,
venimmo in parte dove il nocchier forte
Â«UsciteciÂ», gridÃ²: Â«qui Ã¨ lâintrataÂ».

Io vidi piÃ¹ di mille in su le porte
da ciel piovuti, che stizzosamente
dicean: Â«Chi Ã¨ costui che sanza morte

va per lo regno de la morta gente?Â».
E âl savio mio maestro fece segno
di voler lor parlar segretamente.

Allor chiusero un poco il gran disdegno
e disser: Â«Vien tu solo, e quei sen vada
che sÃ¬ ardito intrÃ² per questo regno.

Sol si ritorni per la folle strada:
pruovi, se sa; chÃ© tu qui rimarrai,
che li haâ iscorta sÃ¬ buia contradaÂ».

Pensa, lettor, se io mi sconfortai
nel suon de le parole maladette,
chÃ© non credetti ritornarci mai.

Â«O caro duca mio, che piÃ¹ di sette
volte mâhai sicurtÃ  renduta e tratto
dâalto periglio che âncontra mi stette,

non mi lasciarÂ», dissâ io, Â«cosÃ¬ disfatto;
e se âl passar piÃ¹ oltre ci Ã¨ negato,
ritroviam lâorme nostre insieme rattoÂ».

E quel segnor che lÃ¬ mâavea menato,
mi disse: Â«Non temer; chÃ© âl nostro passo
non ci puÃ² tÃ²rre alcun: da tal nâÃ¨ dato.

Ma qui mâattendi, e lo spirito lasso
conforta e ciba di speranza buona,
châiâ non ti lascerÃ² nel mondo bassoÂ».

CosÃ¬ sen va, e quivi mâabbandona
lo dolce padre, e io rimagno in forse,
che sÃ¬ e no nel capo mi tenciona.

Udir non potti quello châa lor porse;
ma ei non stette lÃ  con essi guari,
che ciascun dentro a pruova si ricorse.

Chiuser le porte queâ nostri avversari
nel petto al mio segnor, che fuor rimase
e rivolsesi a me con passi rari.

Li occhi a la terra e le ciglia avea rase
dâogne baldanza, e dicea neâ sospiri:
Â«Chi mâha negate le dolenti case!Â».

E a me disse: Â«Tu, perchâ io mâadiri,
non sbigottir, châio vincerÃ² la prova,
qual châa la difension dentro sâaggiri.

Questa lor tracotanza non Ã¨ nova;
chÃ© giÃ  lâusaro a men segreta porta,
la qual sanza serrame ancor si trova.

Sovrâ essa vedestÃ¹ la scritta morta:
e giÃ  di qua da lei discende lâerta,
passando per li cerchi sanza scorta,

tal che per lui ne fia la terra apertaÂ».



Inferno Â· Canto IX


Quel color che viltÃ  di fuor mi pinse
veggendo il duca mio tornare in volta,
piÃ¹ tosto dentro il suo novo ristrinse.

Attento si fermÃ² comâ uom châascolta;
chÃ© lâocchio nol potea menare a lunga
per lâaere nero e per la nebbia folta.

Â«Pur a noi converrÃ  vincer la pungaÂ»,
cominciÃ² el, Â«se non . . . Tal ne sâofferse.
Oh quanto tarda a me châaltri qui giunga!Â».

Iâ vidi ben sÃ¬ comâ ei ricoperse
lo cominciar con lâaltro che poi venne,
che fur parole a le prime diverse;

ma nondimen paura il suo dir dienne,
perchâ io traeva la parola tronca
forse a peggior sentenzia che non tenne.

Â«In questo fondo de la trista conca
discende mai alcun del primo grado,
che sol per pena ha la speranza cionca?Â».

Questa question fecâ io; e quei Â«Di rado
incontraÂ», mi rispuose, Â«che di noi
faccia il cammino alcun per qual io vado.

Ver Ã¨ châaltra fÃ¯ata qua giÃ¹ fui,
congiurato da quella EritÃ³n cruda
che richiamava lâombre aâ corpi sui.

Di poco era di me la carne nuda,
châella mi fece intrar dentrâ a quel muro,
per trarne un spirto del cerchio di Giuda.

Quellâ Ã¨ âl piÃ¹ basso loco e âl piÃ¹ oscuro,
e âl piÃ¹ lontan dal ciel che tutto gira:
ben so âl cammin; perÃ² ti fa sicuro.

Questa palude che âl gran puzzo spira
cigne dintorno la cittÃ  dolente,
uâ non potemo intrare omai sanzâ iraÂ».

E altro disse, ma non lâho a mente;
perÃ² che lâocchio mâavea tutto tratto
verâ lâalta torre a la cima rovente,

dove in un punto furon dritte ratto
tre furÃ¯e infernal di sangue tinte,
che membra feminine avieno e atto,

e con idre verdissime eran cinte;
serpentelli e ceraste avien per crine,
onde le fiere tempie erano avvinte.

E quei, che ben conobbe le meschine
de la regina de lâetterno pianto,
Â«GuardaÂ», mi disse, Â«le feroci Erine.

Questâ Ã¨ Megera dal sinistro canto;
quella che piange dal destro Ã¨ Aletto;
TesifÃ³n Ã¨ nel mezzoÂ»; e tacque a tanto.

Con lâunghie si fendea ciascuna il petto;
battiensi a palme e gridavan sÃ¬ alto,
châiâ mi strinsi al poeta per sospetto.

Â«Vegna Medusa: sÃ¬ âl farem di smaltoÂ»,
dicevan tutte riguardando in giuso;
Â«mal non vengiammo in TesÃ«o lâassaltoÂ».

Â«Volgiti ân dietro e tien lo viso chiuso;
chÃ© se âl GorgÃ³n si mostra e tu âl vedessi,
nulla sarebbe di tornar mai susoÂ».

CosÃ¬ disse âl maestro; ed elli stessi
mi volse, e non si tenne a le mie mani,
che con le sue ancor non mi chiudessi.

O voi châavete li ântelletti sani,
mirate la dottrina che sâasconde
sotto âl velame de li versi strani.

E giÃ  venÃ¬a su per le torbide onde
un fracasso dâun suon, pien di spavento,
per cui tremavano amendue le sponde,

non altrimenti fatto che dâun vento
impetÃ¼oso per li avversi ardori,
che fier la selva e sanzâ alcun rattento

li rami schianta, abbatte e porta fori;
dinanzi polveroso va superbo,
e fa fuggir le fiere e li pastori.

Li occhi mi sciolse e disse: Â«Or drizza il nerbo
del viso su per quella schiuma antica
per indi ove quel fummo Ã¨ piÃ¹ acerboÂ».

Come le rane innanzi a la nimica
biscia per lâacqua si dileguan tutte,
fin châa la terra ciascuna sâabbica,

vidâ io piÃ¹ di mille anime distrutte
fuggir cosÃ¬ dinanzi ad un châal passo
passava Stige con le piante asciutte.

Dal volto rimovea quellâ aere grasso,
menando la sinistra innanzi spesso;
e sol di quellâ angoscia parea lasso.

Ben mâaccorsi châelli era da ciel messo,
e volsimi al maestro; e quei fÃ© segno
châiâ stessi queto ed inchinassi ad esso.

Ahi quanto mi parea pien di disdegno!
Venne a la porta e con una verghetta
lâaperse, che non vâebbe alcun ritegno.

Â«O cacciati del ciel, gente dispettaÂ»,
cominciÃ² elli in su lâorribil soglia,
Â«ondâ esta oltracotanza in voi sâalletta?

PerchÃ© recalcitrate a quella voglia
a cui non puote il fin mai esser mozzo,
e che piÃ¹ volte vâha cresciuta doglia?

Che giova ne le fata dar di cozzo?
Cerbero vostro, se ben vi ricorda,
ne porta ancor pelato il mento e âl gozzoÂ».

Poi si rivolse per la strada lorda,
e non fÃ© motto a noi, ma fÃ© sembiante
dâomo cui altra cura stringa e morda

che quella di colui che li Ã¨ davante;
e noi movemmo i piedi inverâ la terra,
sicuri appresso le parole sante.

Dentro li ântrammo sanzâ alcuna guerra;
e io, châavea di riguardar disio
la condizion che tal fortezza serra,

comâ io fui dentro, lâocchio intorno invio:
e veggio ad ogne man grande campagna,
piena di duolo e di tormento rio.

SÃ¬ come ad Arli, ove Rodano stagna,
sÃ¬ comâ a Pola, presso del Carnaro
châItalia chiude e suoi termini bagna,

fanno i sepulcri tuttâ il loco varo,
cosÃ¬ facevan quivi dâogne parte,
salvo che âl modo vâera piÃ¹ amaro;

chÃ© tra li avelli fiamme erano sparte,
per le quali eran sÃ¬ del tutto accesi,
che ferro piÃ¹ non chiede verunâ arte.

Tutti li lor coperchi eran sospesi,
e fuor nâuscivan sÃ¬ duri lamenti,
che ben parean di miseri e dâoffesi.

E io: Â«Maestro, quai son quelle genti
che, seppellite dentro da quellâ arche,
si fan sentir coi sospiri dolenti?Â».

E quelli a me: Â«Qui son li eresÃ¯arche
con lor seguaci, dâogne setta, e molto
piÃ¹ che non credi son le tombe carche.

Simile qui con simile Ã¨ sepolto,
e i monimenti son piÃ¹ e men caldiÂ».
E poi châa la man destra si fu vÃ²lto,

passammo tra i martÃ¬ri e li alti spaldi.



Inferno Â· Canto X


Ora sen va per un secreto calle,
tra âl muro de la terra e li martÃ¬ri,
lo mio maestro, e io dopo le spalle.

Â«O virtÃ¹ somma, che per li empi giri
mi volviÂ», cominciai, Â«comâ a te piace,
parlami, e sodisfammi aâ miei disiri.

La gente che per li sepolcri giace
potrebbesi veder? giÃ  son levati
tuttâ i coperchi, e nessun guardia faceÂ».

E quelli a me: Â«Tutti saran serrati
quando di IosafÃ t qui torneranno
coi corpi che lÃ  sÃ¹ hanno lasciati.

Suo cimitero da questa parte hanno
con Epicuro tutti suoi seguaci,
che lâanima col corpo morta fanno.

PerÃ² a la dimanda che mi faci
quincâ entro satisfatto sarÃ  tosto,
e al disio ancor che tu mi taciÂ».

E io: Â«Buon duca, non tegno riposto
a te mio cuor se non per dicer poco,
e tu mâhai non pur mo a ciÃ² dispostoÂ».

Â«O Tosco che per la cittÃ  del foco
vivo ten vai cosÃ¬ parlando onesto,
piacciati di restare in questo loco.

La tua loquela ti fa manifesto
di quella nobil patrÃ¯a natio,
a la qual forse fui troppo molestoÂ».

Subitamente questo suono uscÃ¬o
dâuna de lâarche; perÃ² mâaccostai,
temendo, un poco piÃ¹ al duca mio.

Ed el mi disse: Â«Volgiti! Che fai?
Vedi lÃ  Farinata che sâÃ¨ dritto:
da la cintola in sÃ¹ tutto âl vedraiÂ».

Io avea giÃ  il mio viso nel suo fitto;
ed el sâergea col petto e con la fronte
comâ avesse lâinferno a gran dispitto.

E lâanimose man del duca e pronte
mi pinser tra le sepulture a lui,
dicendo: Â«Le parole tue sien conteÂ».

Comâ io al piÃ¨ de la sua tomba fui,
guardommi un poco, e poi, quasi sdegnoso,
mi dimandÃ²: Â«Chi fuor li maggior tui?Â».

Io châera dâubidir disideroso,
non gliel celai, ma tutto glielâ apersi;
ondâ ei levÃ² le ciglia un poco in suso;

poi disse: Â«Fieramente furo avversi
a me e a miei primi e a mia parte,
sÃ¬ che per due fÃ¯ate li dispersiÂ».

Â«Sâei fur cacciati, ei tornar dâogne parteÂ»,
rispuosâ io lui, Â«lâuna e lâaltra fÃ¯ata;
ma i vostri non appreser ben quellâ arteÂ».

Allor surse a la vista scoperchiata
unâombra, lungo questa, infino al mento:
credo che sâera in ginocchie levata.

Dintorno mi guardÃ², come talento
avesse di veder sâaltri era meco;
e poi che âl sospecciar fu tutto spento,

piangendo disse: Â«Se per questo cieco
carcere vai per altezza dâingegno,
mio figlio ovâ Ã¨? e perchÃ© non Ã¨ teco?Â».

E io a lui: Â«Da me stesso non vegno:
colui châattende lÃ , per qui mi mena
forse cui Guido vostro ebbe a disdegnoÂ».

Le sue parole e âl modo de la pena
mâavean di costui giÃ  letto il nome;
perÃ² fu la risposta cosÃ¬ piena.

Di sÃ¹bito drizzato gridÃ²: Â«Come?
dicesti âelli ebbeâ? non vivâ elli ancora?
non fiere li occhi suoi lo dolce lume?Â».

Quando sâaccorse dâalcuna dimora
châio facÃ«a dinanzi a la risposta,
supin ricadde e piÃ¹ non parve fora.

Ma quellâ altro magnanimo, a cui posta
restato mâera, non mutÃ² aspetto,
nÃ© mosse collo, nÃ© piegÃ² sua costa;

e sÃ© continÃ¼ando al primo detto,
Â«Sâelli han quellâ arteÂ», disse, Â«male appresa,
ciÃ² mi tormenta piÃ¹ che questo letto.

Ma non cinquanta volte fia raccesa
la faccia de la donna che qui regge,
che tu saprai quanto quellâ arte pesa.

E se tu mai nel dolce mondo regge,
dimmi: perchÃ© quel popolo Ã¨ sÃ¬ empio
incontrâ aâ miei in ciascuna sua legge?Â».

Ondâ io a lui: Â«Lo strazio e âl grande scempio
che fece lâArbia colorata in rosso,
tal orazion fa far nel nostro tempioÂ».

Poi châebbe sospirando il capo mosso,
Â«A ciÃ² non fuâ io solÂ», disse, Â«nÃ© certo
sanza cagion con li altri sarei mosso.

Ma fuâ io solo, lÃ  dove sofferto
fu per ciascun di tÃ²rre via Fiorenza,
colui che la difesi a viso apertoÂ».

Â«Deh, se riposi mai vostra semenzaÂ»,
pregaâ io lui, Â«solvetemi quel nodo
che qui ha ânviluppata mia sentenza.

El par che voi veggiate, se ben odo,
dinanzi quel che âl tempo seco adduce,
e nel presente tenete altro modoÂ».

Â«Noi veggiam, come quei câha mala luce,
le coseÂ», disse, Â«che ne son lontano;
cotanto ancor ne splende il sommo duce.

Quando sâappressano o son, tutto Ã¨ vano
nostro intelletto; e sâaltri non ci apporta,
nulla sapem di vostro stato umano.

PerÃ² comprender puoi che tutta morta
fia nostra conoscenza da quel punto
che del futuro fia chiusa la portaÂ».

Allor, come di mia colpa compunto,
dissi: Â«Or direte dunque a quel caduto
che âl suo nato Ã¨ coâ vivi ancor congiunto;

e sâiâ fui, dianzi, a la risposta muto,
fate i saper che âl fei perchÃ© pensava
giÃ  ne lâerror che mâavete solutoÂ».

E giÃ  âl maestro mio mi richiamava;
per châiâ pregai lo spirto piÃ¹ avaccio
che mi dicesse chi con luâ istava.

Dissemi: Â«Qui con piÃ¹ di mille giaccio:
qua dentro Ã¨ âl secondo Federico
e âl Cardinale; e de li altri mi taccioÂ».

Indi sâascose; e io inverâ lâantico
poeta volsi i passi, ripensando
a quel parlar che mi parea nemico.

Elli si mosse; e poi, cosÃ¬ andando,
mi disse: Â«PerchÃ© seâ tu sÃ¬ smarrito?Â».
E io li sodisfeci al suo dimando.

Â«La mente tua conservi quel châudito
hai contra teÂ», mi comandÃ² quel saggio;
Â«e ora attendi quiÂ», e drizzÃ² âl dito:

Â«quando sarai dinanzi al dolce raggio
di quella il cui bellâ occhio tutto vede,
da lei saprai di tua vita il vÃ¯aggioÂ».

Appresso mosse a man sinistra il piede:
lasciammo il muro e gimmo inverâ lo mezzo
per un sentier châa una valle fiede,

che ânfin lÃ  sÃ¹ facea spiacer suo lezzo.



Inferno Â· Canto XI


In su lâestremitÃ  dâunâalta ripa
che facevan gran pietre rotte in cerchio,
venimmo sopra piÃ¹ crudele stipa;

e quivi, per lâorribile soperchio
del puzzo che âl profondo abisso gitta,
ci raccostammo, in dietro, ad un coperchio

dâun grandâ avello, ovâ io vidi una scritta
che dicea: âAnastasio papa guardo,
lo qual trasse Fotin de la via drittaâ.

Â«Lo nostro scender conviene esser tardo,
sÃ¬ che sâausi un poco in prima il senso
al tristo fiato; e poi no i fia riguardoÂ».

CosÃ¬ âl maestro; e io Â«Alcun compensoÂ»,
dissi lui, Â«trova che âl tempo non passi
perdutoÂ». Ed elli: Â«Vedi châa ciÃ² pensoÂ».

Â«Figliuol mio, dentro da cotesti sassiÂ»,
cominciÃ² poi a dir, Â«son tre cerchietti
di grado in grado, come queâ che lassi.

Tutti son pien di spirti maladetti;
ma perchÃ© poi ti basti pur la vista,
intendi come e perchÃ© son costretti.

Dâogne malizia, châodio in cielo acquista,
ingiuria Ã¨ âl fine, ed ogne fin cotale
o con forza o con frode altrui contrista.

Ma perchÃ© frode Ã¨ de lâuom proprio male,
piÃ¹ spiace a Dio; e perÃ² stan di sotto
li frodolenti, e piÃ¹ dolor li assale.

Di vÃ¯olenti il primo cerchio Ã¨ tutto;
ma perchÃ© si fa forza a tre persone,
in tre gironi Ã¨ distinto e costrutto.

A Dio, a sÃ©, al prossimo si pÃ²ne
far forza, dico in loro e in lor cose,
come udirai con aperta ragione.

Morte per forza e ferute dogliose
nel prossimo si danno, e nel suo avere
ruine, incendi e tollette dannose;

onde omicide e ciascun che mal fiere,
guastatori e predon, tutti tormenta
lo giron primo per diverse schiere.

Puote omo avere in sÃ© man vÃ¯olenta
e neâ suoi beni; e perÃ² nel secondo
giron convien che sanza pro si penta

qualunque priva sÃ© del vostro mondo,
biscazza e fonde la sua facultade,
e piange lÃ  dovâ esser deâ giocondo.

Puossi far forza ne la deÃ¯tade,
col cor negando e bestemmiando quella,
e spregiando natura e sua bontade;

e perÃ² lo minor giron suggella
del segno suo e Soddoma e Caorsa
e chi, spregiando Dio col cor, favella.

La frode, ondâ ogne coscÃ¯enza Ã¨ morsa,
puÃ² lâomo usare in colui che ân lui fida
e in quel che fidanza non imborsa.

Questo modo di retro par châincida
pur lo vinco dâamor che fa natura;
onde nel cerchio secondo sâannida

ipocresia, lusinghe e chi affattura,
falsitÃ , ladroneccio e simonia,
ruffian, baratti e simile lordura.

Per lâaltro modo quellâ amor sâoblia
che fa natura, e quel châÃ¨ poi aggiunto,
di che la fede spezÃ¯al si cria;

onde nel cerchio minore, ovâ Ã¨ âl punto
de lâuniverso in su che Dite siede,
qualunque trade in etterno Ã¨ consuntoÂ».

E io: Â«Maestro, assai chiara procede
la tua ragione, e assai ben distingue
questo barÃ tro e âl popol châeâ possiede.

Ma dimmi: quei de la palude pingue,
che mena il vento, e che batte la pioggia,
e che sâincontran con sÃ¬ aspre lingue,

perchÃ© non dentro da la cittÃ  roggia
sono ei puniti, se Dio li ha in ira?
e se non li ha, perchÃ© sono a tal foggia?Â».

Ed elli a me Â«PerchÃ© tanto deliraÂ»,
disse, Â«lo ângegno tuo da quel che sÃ²le?
o ver la mente dove altrove mira?

Non ti rimembra di quelle parole
con le quai la tua Etica pertratta
le tre disposizion che âl ciel non vole,

incontenenza, malizia e la matta
bestialitade? e come incontenenza
men Dio offende e men biasimo accatta?

Se tu riguardi ben questa sentenza,
e rechiti a la mente chi son quelli
che sÃ¹ di fuor sostegnon penitenza,

tu vedrai ben perchÃ© da questi felli
sien dipartiti, e perchÃ© men crucciata
la divina vendetta li martelliÂ».

Â«O sol che sani ogne vista turbata,
tu mi contenti sÃ¬ quando tu solvi,
che, non men che saver, dubbiar mâaggrata.

Ancora in dietro un poco ti rivolviÂ»,
dissâ io, Â«lÃ  dove diâ châusura offende
la divina bontade, e âl groppo solviÂ».

Â«FilosofiaÂ», mi disse, Â«a chi la ântende,
nota, non pure in una sola parte,
come natura lo suo corso prende

dal divino ântelletto e da sua arte;
e se tu ben la tua Fisica note,
tu troverai, non dopo molte carte,

che lâarte vostra quella, quanto pote,
segue, come âl maestro fa âl discente;
sÃ¬ che vostrâ arte a Dio quasi Ã¨ nepote.

Da queste due, se tu ti rechi a mente
lo GenesÃ¬ dal principio, convene
prender sua vita e avanzar la gente;

e perchÃ© lâusuriere altra via tene,
per sÃ© natura e per la sua seguace
dispregia, poi châin altro pon la spene.

Ma seguimi oramai che âl gir mi piace;
chÃ© i Pesci guizzan su per lâorizzonta,
e âl Carro tutto sovra âl Coro giace,

e âl balzo via lÃ  oltra si dismontaÂ».



Inferno Â· Canto XII


Era lo loco ovâ a scender la riva
venimmo, alpestro e, per quel che vâerâ anco,
tal, châogne vista ne sarebbe schiva.

Qual Ã¨ quella ruina che nel fianco
di qua da Trento lâAdice percosse,
o per tremoto o per sostegno manco,

che da cima del monte, onde si mosse,
al piano Ã¨ sÃ¬ la roccia discoscesa,
châalcuna via darebbe a chi sÃ¹ fosse:

cotal di quel burrato era la scesa;
e ân su la punta de la rotta lacca
lâinfamÃ¯a di Creti era distesa

che fu concetta ne la falsa vacca;
e quando vide noi, sÃ© stesso morse,
sÃ¬ come quei cui lâira dentro fiacca.

Lo savio mio inverâ lui gridÃ²: Â«Forse
tu credi che qui sia âl duca dâAtene,
che sÃ¹ nel mondo la morte ti porse?

PÃ rtiti, bestia, chÃ© questi non vene
ammaestrato da la tua sorella,
ma vassi per veder le vostre peneÂ».

Qual Ã¨ quel toro che si slaccia in quella
câha ricevuto giÃ  âl colpo mortale,
che gir non sa, ma qua e lÃ  saltella,

vidâ io lo Minotauro far cotale;
e quello accorto gridÃ²: Â«Corri al varco;
mentre châeâ ânfuria, Ã¨ buon che tu ti caleÂ».

CosÃ¬ prendemmo via giÃ¹ per lo scarco
di quelle pietre, che spesso moviensi
sotto i miei piedi per lo novo carco.

Io gia pensando; e quei disse: Â«Tu pensi
forse a questa ruina, châÃ¨ guardata
da quellâ ira bestial châiâ ora spensi.

Or voâ che sappi che lâaltra fÃ¯ata
châiâ discesi qua giÃ¹ nel basso inferno,
questa roccia non era ancor cascata.

Ma certo poco pria, se ben discerno,
che venisse colui che la gran preda
levÃ² a Dite del cerchio superno,

da tutte parti lâalta valle feda
tremÃ² sÃ¬, châiâ pensai che lâuniverso
sentisse amor, per lo qual Ã¨ chi creda

piÃ¹ volte il mondo in caÃ²sso converso;
e in quel punto questa vecchia roccia,
qui e altrove, tal fece riverso.

Ma ficca li occhi a valle, chÃ© sâapproccia
la riviera del sangue in la qual bolle
qual che per vÃ¯olenza in altrui nocciaÂ».

Oh cieca cupidigia e ira folle,
che sÃ¬ ci sproni ne la vita corta,
e ne lâetterna poi sÃ¬ mal câimmolle!

Io vidi unâampia fossa in arco torta,
come quella che tutto âl piano abbraccia,
secondo châavea detto la mia scorta;

e tra âl piÃ¨ de la ripa ed essa, in traccia
corrien centauri, armati di saette,
come solien nel mondo andare a caccia.

Veggendoci calar, ciascun ristette,
e de la schiera tre si dipartiro
con archi e asticciuole prima elette;

e lâun gridÃ² da lungi: Â«A qual martiro
venite voi che scendete la costa?
Ditel costinci; se non, lâarco tiroÂ».

Lo mio maestro disse: Â«La risposta
farem noi a ChirÃ³n costÃ  di presso:
mal fu la voglia tua sempre sÃ¬ tostaÂ».

Poi mi tentÃ², e disse: Â«Quelli Ã¨ Nesso,
che morÃ¬ per la bella Deianira,
e fÃ© di sÃ© la vendetta elli stesso.

E quel di mezzo, châal petto si mira,
Ã¨ il gran ChirÃ³n, il qual nodrÃ¬ Achille;
quellâ altro Ã¨ Folo, che fu sÃ¬ pien dâira.

Dintorno al fosso vanno a mille a mille,
saettando qual anima si svelle
del sangue piÃ¹ che sua colpa sortilleÂ».

Noi ci appressammo a quelle fiere isnelle:
ChirÃ³n prese uno strale, e con la cocca
fece la barba in dietro a le mascelle.

Quando sâebbe scoperta la gran bocca,
disse aâ compagni: Â«Siete voi accorti
che quel di retro move ciÃ² châel tocca?

CosÃ¬ non soglion far li piÃ¨ dâi mortiÂ».
E âl mio buon duca, che giÃ  li erâ al petto,
dove le due nature son consorti,

rispuose: Â«Ben Ã¨ vivo, e sÃ¬ soletto
mostrar li mi convien la valle buia;
necessitÃ  âl ci ânduce, e non diletto.

Tal si partÃ¬ da cantare alleluia
che mi commise questâ officio novo:
non Ã¨ ladron, nÃ© io anima fuia.

Ma per quella virtÃ¹ per cuâ io movo
li passi miei per sÃ¬ selvaggia strada,
danne un deâ tuoi, a cui noi siamo a provo,

e che ne mostri lÃ  dove si guada,
e che porti costui in su la groppa,
chÃ© non Ã¨ spirto che per lâaere vadaÂ».

ChirÃ³n si volse in su la destra poppa,
e disse a Nesso: Â«Torna, e sÃ¬ li guida,
e fa cansar sâaltra schiera vâintoppaÂ».

Or ci movemmo con la scorta fida
lungo la proda del bollor vermiglio,
dove i bolliti facieno alte strida.

Io vidi gente sotto infino al ciglio;
e âl gran centauro disse: Â«Eâ son tiranni
che dier nel sangue e ne lâaver di piglio.

Quivi si piangon li spietati danni;
quivi Ã¨ Alessandro, e DÃ¯onisio fero
che fÃ© Cicilia aver dolorosi anni.

E quella fronte câha âl pel cosÃ¬ nero,
Ã¨ Azzolino; e quellâ altro châÃ¨ biondo,
Ã¨ Opizzo da Esti, il qual per vero

fu spento dal figliastro sÃ¹ nel mondoÂ».
Allor mi volsi al poeta, e quei disse:
Â«Questi ti sia or primo, e io secondoÂ».

Poco piÃ¹ oltre il centauro sâaffisse
sovrâ una gente che ânfino a la gola
parea che di quel bulicame uscisse.

Mostrocci unâombra da lâun canto sola,
dicendo: Â«Colui fesse in grembo a Dio
lo cor che ân su Tamisi ancor si colaÂ».

Poi vidi gente che di fuor del rio
tenean la testa e ancor tutto âl casso;
e di costoro assai riconobbâ io.

CosÃ¬ a piÃ¹ a piÃ¹ si facea basso
quel sangue, sÃ¬ che cocea pur li piedi;
e quindi fu del fosso il nostro passo.

Â«SÃ¬ come tu da questa parte vedi
lo bulicame che sempre si scemaÂ»,
disse âl centauro, Â«voglio che tu credi

che da questâ altra a piÃ¹ a piÃ¹ giÃ¹ prema
lo fondo suo, infin châel si raggiunge
ove la tirannia convien che gema.

La divina giustizia di qua punge
quellâ Attila che fu flagello in terra,
e Pirro e Sesto; e in etterno munge

le lagrime, che col bollor diserra,
a Rinier da Corneto, a Rinier Pazzo,
che fecero a le strade tanta guerraÂ».

Poi si rivolse e ripassossi âl guazzo.



Inferno Â· Canto XIII


Non era ancor di lÃ  Nesso arrivato,
quando noi ci mettemmo per un bosco
che da neun sentiero era segnato.

Non fronda verde, ma di color fosco;
non rami schietti, ma nodosi e ânvolti;
non pomi vâeran, ma stecchi con tÃ²sco.

Non han sÃ¬ aspri sterpi nÃ© sÃ¬ folti
quelle fiere selvagge che ân odio hanno
tra Cecina e Corneto i luoghi cÃ³lti.

Quivi le brutte Arpie lor nidi fanno,
che cacciar de le Strofade i Troiani
con tristo annunzio di futuro danno.

Ali hanno late, e colli e visi umani,
piÃ¨ con artigli, e pennuto âl gran ventre;
fanno lamenti in su li alberi strani.

E âl buon maestro Â«Prima che piÃ¹ entre,
sappi che seâ nel secondo gironeÂ»,
mi cominciÃ² a dire, Â«e sarai mentre

che tu verrai ne lâorribil sabbione.
PerÃ² riguarda ben; sÃ¬ vederai
cose che torrien fede al mio sermoneÂ».

Io sentia dâogne parte trarre guai
e non vedea persona che âl facesse;
per châio tutto smarrito mâarrestai.

Credâ Ã¯o châei credette châio credesse
che tante voci uscisser, tra quei bronchi,
da gente che per noi si nascondesse.

PerÃ² disse âl maestro: Â«Se tu tronchi
qualche fraschetta dâuna dâeste piante,
li pensier câhai si faran tutti monchiÂ».

Allor porsi la mano un poco avante
e colsi un ramicel da un gran pruno;
e âl tronco suo gridÃ²: Â«PerchÃ© mi schiante?Â».

Da che fatto fu poi di sangue bruno,
ricominciÃ² a dir: Â«PerchÃ© mi scerpi?
non hai tu spirto di pietade alcuno?

Uomini fummo, e or siam fatti sterpi:
ben dovrebbâ esser la tua man piÃ¹ pia,
se state fossimo anime di serpiÂ».

Come dâun stizzo verde châarso sia
da lâun deâ capi, che da lâaltro geme
e cigola per vento che va via,

sÃ¬ de la scheggia rotta usciva insieme
parole e sangue; ondâ io lasciai la cima
cadere, e stetti come lâuom che teme.

Â«Sâelli avesse potuto creder primaÂ»,
rispuose âl savio mio, Â«anima lesa,
ciÃ² câha veduto pur con la mia rima,

non averebbe in te la man distesa;
ma la cosa incredibile mi fece
indurlo ad ovra châa me stesso pesa.

Ma dilli chi tu fosti, sÃ¬ che ân vece
dâalcunâ ammenda tua fama rinfreschi
nel mondo sÃ¹, dove tornar li leceÂ».

E âl tronco: Â«SÃ¬ col dolce dir mâadeschi,
châiâ non posso tacere; e voi non gravi
perchâ Ã¯o un poco a ragionar mâinveschi.

Io son colui che tenni ambo le chiavi
del cor di Federigo, e che le volsi,
serrando e diserrando, sÃ¬ soavi,

che dal secreto suo quasi ognâ uom tolsi;
fede portai al glorÃ¯oso offizio,
tanto châiâ ne perdeâ li sonni e â polsi.

La meretrice che mai da lâospizio
di Cesare non torse li occhi putti,
morte comune e de le corti vizio,

infiammÃ² contra me li animi tutti;
e li ânfiammati infiammar sÃ¬ Augusto,
che â lieti onor tornaro in tristi lutti.

Lâanimo mio, per disdegnoso gusto,
credendo col morir fuggir disdegno,
ingiusto fece me contra me giusto.

Per le nove radici dâesto legno
vi giuro che giÃ  mai non ruppi fede
al mio segnor, che fu dâonor sÃ¬ degno.

E se di voi alcun nel mondo riede,
conforti la memoria mia, che giace
ancor del colpo che ânvidia le diedeÂ».

Un poco attese, e poi Â«Da châel si taceÂ»,
disse âl poeta a me, Â«non perder lâora;
ma parla, e chiedi a lui, se piÃ¹ ti piaceÂ».

Ondâ Ã¯o a lui: Â«Domandal tu ancora
di quel che credi châa me satisfaccia;
châiâ non potrei, tanta pietÃ  mâaccoraÂ».

PerciÃ² ricominciÃ²: Â«Se lâom ti faccia
liberamente ciÃ² che âl tuo dir priega,
spirito incarcerato, ancor ti piaccia

di dirne come lâanima si lega
in questi nocchi; e dinne, se tu puoi,
sâalcuna mai di tai membra si spiegaÂ».

Allor soffiÃ² il tronco forte, e poi
si convertÃ¬ quel vento in cotal voce:
Â«Brievemente sarÃ  risposto a voi.

Quando si parte lâanima feroce
dal corpo ondâ ella stessa sâÃ¨ disvelta,
MinÃ²s la manda a la settima foce.

Cade in la selva, e non lâÃ¨ parte scelta;
ma lÃ  dove fortuna la balestra,
quivi germoglia come gran di spelta.

Surge in vermena e in pianta silvestra:
lâArpie, pascendo poi de le sue foglie,
fanno dolore, e al dolor fenestra.

Come lâaltre verrem per nostre spoglie,
ma non perÃ² châalcuna sen rivesta,
chÃ© non Ã¨ giusto aver ciÃ² châom si toglie.

Qui le strascineremo, e per la mesta
selva saranno i nostri corpi appesi,
ciascuno al prun de lâombra sua molestaÂ».

Noi eravamo ancora al tronco attesi,
credendo châaltro ne volesse dire,
quando noi fummo dâun romor sorpresi,

similemente a colui che venire
sente âl porco e la caccia a la sua posta,
châode le bestie, e le frasche stormire.

Ed ecco due da la sinistra costa,
nudi e graffiati, fuggendo sÃ¬ forte,
che de la selva rompieno ogne rosta.

Quel dinanzi: Â«Or accorri, accorri, morte!Â».
E lâaltro, cui pareva tardar troppo,
gridava: Â«Lano, sÃ¬ non furo accorte

le gambe tue a le giostre dal Toppo!Â».
E poi che forse li fallia la lena,
di sÃ© e dâun cespuglio fece un groppo.

Di rietro a loro era la selva piena
di nere cagne, bramose e correnti
come veltri châuscisser di catena.

In quel che sâappiattÃ² miser li denti,
e quel dilaceraro a brano a brano;
poi sen portar quelle membra dolenti.

Presemi allor la mia scorta per mano,
e menommi al cespuglio che piangea
per le rotture sanguinenti in vano.

Â«O IacopoÂ», dicea, Â«da Santo Andrea,
che tâÃ¨ giovato di me fare schermo?
che colpa ho io de la tua vita rea?Â».

Quando âl maestro fu sovrâ esso fermo,
disse: Â«Chi fosti, che per tante punte
soffi con sangue doloroso sermo?Â».

Ed elli a noi: Â«O anime che giunte
siete a veder lo strazio disonesto
câha le mie fronde sÃ¬ da me disgiunte,

raccoglietele al piÃ¨ del tristo cesto.
Iâ fui de la cittÃ  che nel Batista
mutÃ² âl primo padrone; ondâ ei per questo

sempre con lâarte sua la farÃ  trista;
e se non fosse che ân sul passo dâArno
rimane ancor di lui alcuna vista,

queâ cittadin che poi la rifondarno
sovra âl cener che dâAttila rimase,
avrebber fatto lavorare indarno.

Io fei gibetto a me de le mie caseÂ».



Inferno Â· Canto XIV


Poi che la caritÃ  del natio loco
mi strinse, raunai le fronde sparte
e rendeâle a colui, châera giÃ  fioco.

Indi venimmo al fine ove si parte
lo secondo giron dal terzo, e dove
si vede di giustizia orribil arte.

A ben manifestar le cose nove,
dico che arrivammo ad una landa
che dal suo letto ogne pianta rimove.

La dolorosa selva lâÃ¨ ghirlanda
intorno, come âl fosso tristo ad essa;
quivi fermammo i passi a randa a randa.

Lo spazzo era una rena arida e spessa,
non dâaltra foggia fatta che colei
che fu daâ piÃ¨ di Caton giÃ  soppressa.

O vendetta di Dio, quanto tu dei
esser temuta da ciascun che legge
ciÃ² che fu manifesto a li occhi mei!

Dâanime nude vidi molte gregge
che piangean tutte assai miseramente,
e parea posta lor diversa legge.

Supin giacea in terra alcuna gente,
alcuna si sedea tutta raccolta,
e altra andava continÃ¼amente.

Quella che giva ântorno era piÃ¹ molta,
e quella men che giacÃ«a al tormento,
ma piÃ¹ al duolo avea la lingua sciolta.

Sovra tutto âl sabbion, dâun cader lento,
piovean di foco dilatate falde,
come di neve in alpe sanza vento.

Quali Alessandro in quelle parti calde
dâIndÃ¯a vide sopra âl sÃ¼o stuolo
fiamme cadere infino a terra salde,

per châei provide a scalpitar lo suolo
con le sue schiere, acciÃ² che lo vapore
mei si stingueva mentre châera solo:

tale scendeva lâetternale ardore;
onde la rena sâaccendea, comâ esca
sotto focile, a doppiar lo dolore.

Sanza riposo mai era la tresca
de le misere mani, or quindi or quinci
escotendo da sÃ© lâarsura fresca.

Iâ cominciai: Â«Maestro, tu che vinci
tutte le cose, fuor che â demon duri
châa lâintrar de la porta incontra uscinci,

chi Ã¨ quel grande che non par che curi
lo âncendio e giace dispettoso e torto,
sÃ¬ che la pioggia non par che âl marturi?Â».

E quel medesmo, che si fu accorto
châio domandava il mio duca di lui,
gridÃ²: Â«Qual io fui vivo, tal son morto.

Se Giove stanchi âl suo fabbro da cui
crucciato prese la folgore aguta
onde lâultimo dÃ¬ percosso fui;

o sâelli stanchi li altri a muta a muta
in Mongibello a la focina negra,
chiamando âBuon Vulcano, aiuta, aiuta!â,

sÃ¬ comâ el fece a la pugna di Flegra,
e me saetti con tutta sua forza:
non ne potrebbe aver vendetta allegraÂ».

Allora il duca mio parlÃ² di forza
tanto, châiâ non lâavea sÃ¬ forte udito:
Â«O Capaneo, in ciÃ² che non sâammorza

la tua superbia, seâ tu piÃ¹ punito;
nullo martiro, fuor che la tua rabbia,
sarebbe al tuo furor dolor compitoÂ».

Poi si rivolse a me con miglior labbia,
dicendo: Â«Quei fu lâun dâi sette regi
châassiser Tebe; ed ebbe e par châelli abbia

Dio in disdegno, e poco par che âl pregi;
ma, comâ io dissi lui, li suoi dispetti
sono al suo petto assai debiti fregi.

Or mi vien dietro, e guarda che non metti,
ancor, li piedi ne la rena arsiccia;
ma sempre al bosco tien li piedi strettiÂ».

Tacendo divenimmo lÃ  âve spiccia
fuor de la selva un picciol fiumicello,
lo cui rossore ancor mi raccapriccia.

Quale del Bulicame esce ruscello
che parton poi tra lor le peccatrici,
tal per la rena giÃ¹ sen giva quello.

Lo fondo suo e ambo le pendici
fattâ era ân pietra, e â margini dallato;
per châio mâaccorsi che âl passo era lici.

Â«Tra tutto lâaltro châiâ tâho dimostrato,
poscia che noi intrammo per la porta
lo cui sogliare a nessuno Ã¨ negato,

cosa non fu da li tuoi occhi scorta
notabile comâ Ã¨ âl presente rio,
che sovra sÃ© tutte fiammelle ammortaÂ».

Queste parole fuor del duca mio;
per châio âl pregai che mi largisse âl pasto
di cui largito mâavÃ«a il disio.

Â«In mezzo mar siede un paese guastoÂ»,
dissâ elli allora, Â«che sâappella Creta,
sotto âl cui rege fu giÃ  âl mondo casto.

Una montagna vâÃ¨ che giÃ  fu lieta
dâacqua e di fronde, che si chiamÃ² Ida;
or Ã¨ diserta come cosa vieta.

RÃ«a la scelse giÃ  per cuna fida
del suo figliuolo, e per celarlo meglio,
quando piangea, vi facea far le grida.

Dentro dal monte sta dritto un gran veglio,
che tien volte le spalle inverâ Dammiata
e Roma guarda come sÃ¼o speglio.

La sua testa Ã¨ di fin oro formata,
e puro argento son le braccia e âl petto,
poi Ã¨ di rame infino a la forcata;

da indi in giuso Ã¨ tutto ferro eletto,
salvo che âl destro piede Ã¨ terra cotta;
e sta ân su quel, piÃ¹ che ân su lâaltro, eretto.

Ciascuna parte, fuor che lâoro, Ã¨ rotta
dâuna fessura che lagrime goccia,
le quali, accolte, fÃ³ran quella grotta.

Lor corso in questa valle si diroccia;
fanno Acheronte, Stige e Flegetonta;
poi sen van giÃ¹ per questa stretta doccia,

infin, lÃ  ove piÃ¹ non si dismonta,
fanno Cocito; e qual sia quello stagno
tu lo vedrai, perÃ² qui non si contaÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Se âl presente rigagno
si diriva cosÃ¬ dal nostro mondo,
perchÃ© ci appar pur a questo vivagno?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«Tu sai che âl loco Ã¨ tondo;
e tutto che tu sie venuto molto,
pur a sinistra, giÃ¹ calando al fondo,

non seâ ancor per tutto âl cerchio vÃ²lto;
per che, se cosa nâapparisce nova,
non deâ addur maraviglia al tuo voltoÂ».

E io ancor: Â«Maestro, ove si trova
Flegetonta e LetÃ¨? chÃ© de lâun taci,
e lâaltro diâ che si fa dâesta piovaÂ».

Â«In tutte tue question certo mi piaciÂ»,
rispuose, Â«ma âl bollor de lâacqua rossa
dovea ben solver lâuna che tu faci.

LetÃ¨ vedrai, ma fuor di questa fossa,
lÃ  dove vanno lâanime a lavarsi
quando la colpa pentuta Ã¨ rimossaÂ».

Poi disse: Â«Omai Ã¨ tempo da scostarsi
dal bosco; fa che di retro a me vegne:
li margini fan via, che non son arsi,

e sopra loro ogne vapor si spegneÂ».



Inferno Â· Canto XV


Ora cen porta lâun deâ duri margini;
e âl fummo del ruscel di sopra aduggia,
sÃ¬ che dal foco salva lâacqua e li argini.

Quali Fiamminghi tra Guizzante e Bruggia,
temendo âl fiotto che ânverâ lor sâavventa,
fanno lo schermo perchÃ© âl mar si fuggia;

e quali Padoan lungo la Brenta,
per difender lor ville e lor castelli,
anzi che Carentana il caldo senta:

a tale imagine eran fatti quelli,
tutto che nÃ© sÃ¬ alti nÃ© sÃ¬ grossi,
qual che si fosse, lo maestro fÃ©lli.

GiÃ  eravam da la selva rimossi
tanto, châiâ non avrei visto dovâ era,
perchâ io in dietro rivolto mi fossi,

quando incontrammo dâanime una schiera
che venian lungo lâargine, e ciascuna
ci riguardava come suol da sera

guardare uno altro sotto nuova luna;
e sÃ¬ verâ noi aguzzavan le ciglia
come âl vecchio sartor fa ne la cruna.

CosÃ¬ adocchiato da cotal famiglia,
fui conosciuto da un, che mi prese
per lo lembo e gridÃ²: Â«Qual maraviglia!Â».

E io, quando âl suo braccio a me distese,
ficcaÃ¯ li occhi per lo cotto aspetto,
sÃ¬ che âl viso abbrusciato non difese

la conoscenza sÃ¼a al mio ântelletto;
e chinando la mano a la sua faccia,
rispuosi: Â«Siete voi qui, ser Brunetto?Â».

E quelli: Â«O figliuol mio, non ti dispiaccia
se Brunetto Latino un poco teco
ritorna ân dietro e lascia andar la tracciaÂ».

Iâ dissi lui: Â«Quanto posso, ven preco;
e se volete che con voi mâasseggia,
farÃ²l, se piace a costui che vo secoÂ».

Â«O figliuolÂ», disse, Â«qual di questa greggia
sâarresta punto, giace poi centâ anni
sanzâ arrostarsi quando âl foco il feggia.

PerÃ² va oltre: iâ ti verrÃ² aâ panni;
e poi rigiugnerÃ² la mia masnada,
che va piangendo i suoi etterni danniÂ».

Io non osava scender de la strada
per andar par di lui; ma âl capo chino
tenea comâ uom che reverente vada.

El cominciÃ²: Â«Qual fortuna o destino
anzi lâultimo dÃ¬ qua giÃ¹ ti mena?
e chi Ã¨ questi che mostra âl cammino?Â».

Â«LÃ  sÃ¹ di sopra, in la vita serenaÂ»,
rispuosâ io lui, Â«mi smarriâ in una valle,
avanti che lâetÃ  mia fosse piena.

Pur ier mattina le volsi le spalle:
questi mâapparve, tornandâ Ã¯o in quella,
e reducemi a ca per questo calleÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«Se tu segui tua stella,
non puoi fallire a glorÃ¯oso porto,
se ben mâaccorsi ne la vita bella;

e sâio non fossi sÃ¬ per tempo morto,
veggendo il cielo a te cosÃ¬ benigno,
dato tâavrei a lâopera conforto.

Ma quello ingrato popolo maligno
che discese di Fiesole ab antico,
e tiene ancor del monte e del macigno,

ti si farÃ , per tuo ben far, nimico;
ed Ã¨ ragion, chÃ© tra li lazzi sorbi
si disconvien fruttare al dolce fico.

Vecchia fama nel mondo li chiama orbi;
gentâ Ã¨ avara, invidiosa e superba:
dai lor costumi fa che tu ti forbi.

La tua fortuna tanto onor ti serba,
che lâuna parte e lâaltra avranno fame
di te; ma lungi fia dal becco lâerba.

Faccian le bestie fiesolane strame
di lor medesme, e non tocchin la pianta,
sâalcuna surge ancora in lor letame,

in cui riviva la sementa santa
di queâ Roman che vi rimaser quando
fu fatto il nido di malizia tantaÂ».

Â«Se fosse tutto pieno il mio dimandoÂ»,
rispuosâ io lui, Â«voi non sareste ancora
de lâumana natura posto in bando;

chÃ© ân la mente mâÃ¨ fitta, e or mâaccora,
la cara e buona imagine paterna
di voi quando nel mondo ad ora ad ora

mâinsegnavate come lâuom sâetterna:
e quantâ io lâabbia in grado, mentrâ io vivo
convien che ne la mia lingua si scerna.

CiÃ² che narrate di mio corso scrivo,
e serbolo a chiosar con altro testo
a donna che saprÃ , sâa lei arrivo.

Tanto voglâ io che vi sia manifesto,
pur che mia coscÃ¯enza non mi garra,
châa la Fortuna, come vuol, son presto.

Non Ã¨ nuova a li orecchi miei tal arra:
perÃ² giri Fortuna la sua rota
come le piace, e âl villan la sua marraÂ».

Lo mio maestro allora in su la gota
destra si volse in dietro e riguardommi;
poi disse: Â«Bene ascolta chi la notaÂ».

NÃ© per tanto di men parlando vommi
con ser Brunetto, e dimando chi sono
li suoi compagni piÃ¹ noti e piÃ¹ sommi.

Ed elli a me: Â«Saper dâalcuno Ã¨ buono;
de li altri fia laudabile tacerci,
chÃ© âl tempo saria corto a tanto suono.

In somma sappi che tutti fur cherci
e litterati grandi e di gran fama,
dâun peccato medesmo al mondo lerci.

Priscian sen va con quella turba grama,
e Francesco dâAccorso anche; e vedervi,
sâavessi avuto di tal tigna brama,

colui potei che dal servo deâ servi
fu trasmutato dâArno in Bacchiglione,
dove lasciÃ² li mal protesi nervi.

Di piÃ¹ direi; ma âl venire e âl sermone
piÃ¹ lungo esser non puÃ², perÃ² châiâ veggio
lÃ  surger nuovo fummo del sabbione.

Gente vien con la quale esser non deggio.
Sieti raccomandato il mio Tesoro,
nel qual io vivo ancora, e piÃ¹ non cheggioÂ».

Poi si rivolse, e parve di coloro
che corrono a Verona il drappo verde
per la campagna; e parve di costoro

quelli che vince, non colui che perde.



Inferno Â· Canto XVI


GiÃ  era in loco onde sâudia âl rimbombo
de lâacqua che cadea ne lâaltro giro,
simile a quel che lâarnie fanno rombo,

quando tre ombre insieme si partiro,
correndo, dâuna torma che passava
sotto la pioggia de lâaspro martiro.

Venian verâ noi, e ciascuna gridava:
Â«SÃ²stati tu châa lâabito ne sembri
esser alcun di nostra terra pravaÂ».

AhimÃ¨, che piaghe vidi neâ lor membri,
ricenti e vecchie, da le fiamme incese!
Ancor men duol pur châiâ me ne rimembri.

A le lor grida il mio dottor sâattese;
volse âl viso verâ me, e Â«Or aspettaÂ»,
disse, Â«a costor si vuole esser cortese.

E se non fosse il foco che saetta
la natura del loco, iâ dicerei
che meglio stesse a te che a lor la frettaÂ».

Ricominciar, come noi restammo, ei
lâantico verso; e quando a noi fuor giunti,
fenno una rota di sÃ© tutti e trei.

Qual sogliono i campion far nudi e unti,
avvisando lor presa e lor vantaggio,
prima che sien tra lor battuti e punti,

cosÃ¬ rotando, ciascuno il visaggio
drizzava a me, sÃ¬ che ân contraro il collo
faceva ai piÃ¨ continÃ¼o vÃ¯aggio.

E Â«Se miseria dâesto loco sollo
rende in dispetto noi e nostri prieghiÂ»,
cominciÃ² lâuno, Â«e âl tinto aspetto e brollo,

la fama nostra il tuo animo pieghi
a dirne chi tu seâ, che i vivi piedi
cosÃ¬ sicuro per lo ânferno freghi.

Questi, lâorme di cui pestar mi vedi,
tutto che nudo e dipelato vada,
fu di grado maggior che tu non credi:

nepote fu de la buona Gualdrada;
Guido Guerra ebbe nome, e in sua vita
fece col senno assai e con la spada.

Lâaltro, châappresso me la rena trita,
Ã¨ Tegghiaio Aldobrandi, la cui voce
nel mondo sÃ¹ dovria esser gradita.

E io, che posto son con loro in croce,
Iacopo Rusticucci fui, e certo
la fiera moglie piÃ¹ châaltro mi nuoceÂ».

Sâiâ fossi stato dal foco coperto,
gittato mi sarei tra lor di sotto,
e credo che âl dottor lâavria sofferto;

ma perchâ io mi sarei brusciato e cotto,
vinse paura la mia buona voglia
che di loro abbracciar mi facea ghiotto.

Poi cominciai: Â«Non dispetto, ma doglia
la vostra condizion dentro mi fisse,
tanta che tardi tutta si dispoglia,

tosto che questo mio segnor mi disse
parole per le quali iâ mi pensai
che qual voi siete, tal gente venisse.

Di vostra terra sono, e sempre mai
lâovra di voi e li onorati nomi
con affezion ritrassi e ascoltai.

Lascio lo fele e vo per dolci pomi
promessi a me per lo verace duca;
ma ânfino al centro pria convien châiâ tomiÂ».

Â«Se lungamente lâanima conduca
le membra tueÂ», rispuose quelli ancora,
Â«e se la fama tua dopo te luca,

cortesia e valor dÃ¬ se dimora
ne la nostra cittÃ  sÃ¬ come suole,
o se del tutto se nâÃ¨ gita fora;

chÃ© Guiglielmo Borsiere, il qual si duole
con noi per poco e va lÃ  coi compagni,
assai ne cruccia con le sue paroleÂ».

Â«La gente nuova e i sÃ¹biti guadagni
orgoglio e dismisura han generata,
Fiorenza, in te, sÃ¬ che tu giÃ  ten piagniÂ».

CosÃ¬ gridai con la faccia levata;
e i tre, che ciÃ² inteser per risposta,
guardar lâun lâaltro comâ al ver si guata.

Â«Se lâaltre volte sÃ¬ poco ti costaÂ»,
rispuoser tutti, Â«il satisfare altrui,
felice te se sÃ¬ parli a tua posta!

PerÃ², se campi dâesti luoghi bui
e torni a riveder le belle stelle,
quando ti gioverÃ  dicere âIâ fuiâ,

fa che di noi a la gente favelleÂ».
Indi rupper la rota, e a fuggirsi
ali sembiar le gambe loro isnelle.

Un amen non saria possuto dirsi
tosto cosÃ¬ comâ eâ fuoro spariti;
per châal maestro parve di partirsi.

Io lo seguiva, e poco eravam iti,
che âl suon de lâacqua nâera sÃ¬ vicino,
che per parlar saremmo a pena uditi.

Come quel fiume câha proprio cammino
prima dal Monte Viso ânverâ levante,
da la sinistra costa dâApennino,

che si chiama Acquacheta suso, avante
che si divalli giÃ¹ nel basso letto,
e a ForlÃ¬ di quel nome Ã¨ vacante,

rimbomba lÃ  sovra San Benedetto
de lâAlpe per cadere ad una scesa
ove dovea per mille esser recetto;

cosÃ¬, giÃ¹ dâuna ripa discoscesa,
trovammo risonar quellâ acqua tinta,
sÃ¬ che ân pocâ ora avria lâorecchia offesa.

Io avea una corda intorno cinta,
e con essa pensai alcuna volta
prender la lonza a la pelle dipinta.

Poscia châio lâebbi tutta da me sciolta,
sÃ¬ come âl duca mâavea comandato,
porsila a lui aggroppata e ravvolta.

Ondâ ei si volse inverâ lo destro lato,
e alquanto di lunge da la sponda
la gittÃ² giuso in quellâ alto burrato.

âEâ pur convien che novitÃ  rispondaâ,
dicea fra me medesmo, âal novo cenno
che âl maestro con lâocchio sÃ¬ secondaâ.

Ahi quanto cauti li uomini esser dienno
presso a color che non veggion pur lâovra,
ma per entro i pensier miran col senno!

El disse a me: Â«Tosto verrÃ  di sovra
ciÃ² châio attendo e che il tuo pensier sogna;
tosto convien châal tuo viso si scovraÂ».

Sempre a quel ver câha faccia di menzogna
deâ lâuom chiuder le labbra fin châel puote,
perÃ² che sanza colpa fa vergogna;

ma qui tacer nol posso; e per le note
di questa comedÃ¬a, lettor, ti giuro,
sâelle non sien di lunga grazia vÃ²te,

châiâ vidi per quellâ aere grosso e scuro
venir notando una figura in suso,
maravigliosa ad ogne cor sicuro,

sÃ¬ come torna colui che va giuso
talora a solver lâÃ ncora châaggrappa
o scoglio o altro che nel mare Ã¨ chiuso,

che ân sÃ¹ si stende e da piÃ¨ si rattrappa.



Inferno Â· Canto XVII


Â«Ecco la fiera con la coda aguzza,
che passa i monti e rompe i muri e lâarmi!
Ecco colei che tutto âl mondo appuzza!Â».

SÃ¬ cominciÃ² lo mio duca a parlarmi;
e accennolle che venisse a proda,
vicino al fin dâi passeggiati marmi.

E quella sozza imagine di froda
sen venne, e arrivÃ² la testa e âl busto,
ma ân su la riva non trasse la coda.

La faccia sua era faccia dâuom giusto,
tanto benigna avea di fuor la pelle,
e dâun serpente tutto lâaltro fusto;

due branche avea pilose insin lâascelle;
lo dosso e âl petto e ambedue le coste
dipinti avea di nodi e di rotelle.

Con piÃ¹ color, sommesse e sovraposte
non fer mai drappi Tartari nÃ© Turchi,
nÃ© fuor tai tele per Aragne imposte.

Come talvolta stanno a riva i burchi,
che parte sono in acqua e parte in terra,
e come lÃ  tra li Tedeschi lurchi

lo bivero sâassetta a far sua guerra,
cosÃ¬ la fiera pessima si stava
su lâorlo châÃ¨ di pietra e âl sabbion serra.

Nel vano tutta sua coda guizzava,
torcendo in sÃ¹ la venenosa forca
châa guisa di scorpion la punta armava.

Lo duca disse: Â«Or convien che si torca
la nostra via un poco insino a quella
bestia malvagia che colÃ  si corcaÂ».

PerÃ² scendemmo a la destra mammella,
e diece passi femmo in su lo stremo,
per ben cessar la rena e la fiammella.

E quando noi a lei venuti semo,
poco piÃ¹ oltre veggio in su la rena
gente seder propinqua al loco scemo.

Quivi âl maestro Â«AcciÃ² che tutta piena
esperÃ¯enza dâesto giron portiÂ»,
mi disse, Â«va, e vedi la lor mena.

Li tuoi ragionamenti sian lÃ  corti;
mentre che torni, parlerÃ² con questa,
che ne conceda i suoi omeri fortiÂ».

CosÃ¬ ancor su per la strema testa
di quel settimo cerchio tutto solo
andai, dove sedea la gente mesta.

Per li occhi fora scoppiava lor duolo;
di qua, di lÃ  soccorrien con le mani
quando aâ vapori, e quando al caldo suolo:

non altrimenti fan di state i cani
or col ceffo or col piÃ¨, quando son morsi
o da pulci o da mosche o da tafani.

Poi che nel viso a certi li occhi porsi,
neâ quali âl doloroso foco casca,
non ne conobbi alcun; ma io mâaccorsi

che dal collo a ciascun pendea una tasca
châavea certo colore e certo segno,
e quindi par che âl loro occhio si pasca.

E comâ io riguardando tra lor vegno,
in una borsa gialla vidi azzurro
che dâun leone avea faccia e contegno.

Poi, procedendo di mio sguardo il curro,
vidine unâaltra come sangue rossa,
mostrando unâoca bianca piÃ¹ che burro.

E un che dâuna scrofa azzurra e grossa
segnato avea lo suo sacchetto bianco,
mi disse: Â«Che fai tu in questa fossa?

Or te ne va; e perchÃ© seâ vivo anco,
sappi che âl mio vicin VitalÃ¯ano
sederÃ  qui dal mio sinistro fianco.

Con questi Fiorentin son padoano:
spesse fÃ¯ate mi ântronan li orecchi
gridando: âVegna âl cavalier sovrano,

che recherÃ  la tasca con tre becchi!âÂ».
Qui distorse la bocca e di fuor trasse
la lingua, come bue che âl naso lecchi.

E io, temendo no âl piÃ¹ star crucciasse
lui che di poco star mâavea âmmonito,
tornaâmi in dietro da lâanime lasse.

Trovaâ il duca mio châera salito
giÃ  su la groppa del fiero animale,
e disse a me: Â«Or sie forte e ardito.

Omai si scende per sÃ¬ fatte scale;
monta dinanzi, châiâ voglio esser mezzo,
sÃ¬ che la coda non possa far maleÂ».

Qual Ã¨ colui che sÃ¬ presso ha âl riprezzo
de la quartana, câha giÃ  lâunghie smorte,
e triema tutto pur guardando âl rezzo,

tal divennâ io a le parole porte;
ma vergogna mi fÃ© le sue minacce,
che innanzi a buon segnor fa servo forte.

Iâ mâassettai in su quelle spallacce;
sÃ¬ volli dir, ma la voce non venne
comâ io credetti: âFa che tu mâabbracceâ.

Ma esso, châaltra volta mi sovvenne
ad altro forse, tosto châiâ montai
con le braccia mâavvinse e mi sostenne;

e disse: Â«GerÃ¯on, moviti omai:
le rote larghe, e lo scender sia poco;
pensa la nova soma che tu haiÂ».

Come la navicella esce di loco
in dietro in dietro, sÃ¬ quindi si tolse;
e poi châal tutto si sentÃ¬ a gioco,

lÃ  âvâ era âl petto, la coda rivolse,
e quella tesa, come anguilla, mosse,
e con le branche lâaere a sÃ© raccolse.

Maggior paura non credo che fosse
quando Fetonte abbandonÃ² li freni,
per che âl ciel, come pare ancor, si cosse;

nÃ© quando Icaro misero le reni
sentÃ¬ spennar per la scaldata cera,
gridando il padre a lui Â«Mala via tieni!Â»,

che fu la mia, quando vidi châiâ era
ne lâaere dâogne parte, e vidi spenta
ogne veduta fuor che de la fera.

Ella sen va notando lenta lenta;
rota e discende, ma non me nâaccorgo
se non che al viso e di sotto mi venta.

Io sentia giÃ  da la man destra il gorgo
far sotto noi un orribile scroscio,
per che con li occhi ân giÃ¹ la testa sporgo.

Allor fuâ io piÃ¹ timido a lo stoscio,
perÃ² châiâ vidi fuochi e sentiâ pianti;
ondâ io tremando tutto mi raccoscio.

E vidi poi, chÃ© nol vedea davanti,
lo scendere e âl girar per li gran mali
che sâappressavan da diversi canti.

Come âl falcon châÃ¨ stato assai su lâali,
che sanza veder logoro o uccello
fa dire al falconiere Â«OmÃ¨, tu cali!Â»,

discende lasso onde si move isnello,
per cento rote, e da lunge si pone
dal suo maestro, disdegnoso e fello;

cosÃ¬ ne puose al fondo GerÃ¯one
al piÃ¨ al piÃ¨ de la stagliata rocca,
e, discarcate le nostre persone,

si dileguÃ² come da corda cocca.



Inferno Â· Canto XVIII


Luogo Ã¨ in inferno detto Malebolge,
tutto di pietra di color ferrigno,
come la cerchia che dintorno il volge.

Nel dritto mezzo del campo maligno
vaneggia un pozzo assai largo e profondo,
di cui suo loco dicerÃ² lâordigno.

Quel cinghio che rimane adunque Ã¨ tondo
tra âl pozzo e âl piÃ¨ de lâalta ripa dura,
e ha distinto in dieci valli il fondo.

Quale, dove per guardia de le mura
piÃ¹ e piÃ¹ fossi cingon li castelli,
la parte dove son rende figura,

tale imagine quivi facean quelli;
e come a tai fortezze daâ lor sogli
a la ripa di fuor son ponticelli,

cosÃ¬ da imo de la roccia scogli
movien che ricidien li argini e â fossi
infino al pozzo che i tronca e raccogli.

In questo luogo, de la schiena scossi
di GerÃ¯on, trovammoci; e âl poeta
tenne a sinistra, e io dietro mi mossi.

A la man destra vidi nova pieta,
novo tormento e novi frustatori,
di che la prima bolgia era repleta.

Nel fondo erano ignudi i peccatori;
dal mezzo in qua ci venien verso âl volto,
di lÃ  con noi, ma con passi maggiori,

come i Roman per lâessercito molto,
lâanno del giubileo, su per lo ponte
hanno a passar la gente modo colto,

che da lâun lato tutti hanno la fronte
verso âl castello e vanno a Santo Pietro,
da lâaltra sponda vanno verso âl monte.

Di qua, di lÃ , su per lo sasso tetro
vidi demon cornuti con gran ferze,
che li battien crudelmente di retro.

Ahi come facean lor levar le berze
a le prime percosse! giÃ  nessuno
le seconde aspettava nÃ© le terze.

Mentrâ io andava, li occhi miei in uno
furo scontrati; e io sÃ¬ tosto dissi:
Â«GiÃ  di veder costui non son digiunoÂ».

Per châÃ¯o a figurarlo i piedi affissi;
e âl dolce duca meco si ristette,
e assentio châalquanto in dietro gissi.

E quel frustato celar si credette
bassando âl viso; ma poco li valse,
châio dissi: Â«O tu che lâocchio a terra gette,

se le fazion che porti non son false,
Venedico seâ tu Caccianemico.
Ma che ti mena a sÃ¬ pungenti salse?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«Mal volontier lo dico;
ma sforzami la tua chiara favella,
che mi fa sovvenir del mondo antico.

Iâ fui colui che la Ghisolabella
condussi a far la voglia del marchese,
come che suoni la sconcia novella.

E non pur io qui piango bolognese;
anzi nâÃ¨ questo loco tanto pieno,
che tante lingue non son ora apprese

a dicer âsipaâ tra SÃ vena e Reno;
e se di ciÃ² vuoi fede o testimonio,
rÃ¨cati a mente il nostro avaro senoÂ».

CosÃ¬ parlando il percosse un demonio
de la sua scurÃ¯ada, e disse: Â«Via,
ruffian! qui non son femmine da conioÂ».

Iâ mi raggiunsi con la scorta mia;
poscia con pochi passi divenimmo
lÃ  âvâ uno scoglio de la ripa uscia.

Assai leggeramente quel salimmo;
e vÃ²lti a destra su per la sua scheggia,
da quelle cerchie etterne ci partimmo.

Quando noi fummo lÃ  dovâ el vaneggia
di sotto per dar passo a li sferzati,
lo duca disse: Â«Attienti, e fa che feggia

lo viso in te di questâ altri mal nati,
ai quali ancor non vedesti la faccia
perÃ² che son con noi insieme andatiÂ».

Del vecchio ponte guardavam la traccia
che venÃ¬a verso noi da lâaltra banda,
e che la ferza similmente scaccia.

E âl buon maestro, sanza mia dimanda,
mi disse: Â«Guarda quel grande che vene,
e per dolor non par lagrime spanda:

quanto aspetto reale ancor ritene!
Quelli Ã¨ IasÃ³n, che per cuore e per senno
li Colchi del monton privati fÃ©ne.

Ello passÃ² per lâisola di Lenno
poi che lâardite femmine spietate
tutti li maschi loro a morte dienno.

Ivi con segni e con parole ornate
Isifile ingannÃ², la giovinetta
che prima avea tutte lâaltre ingannate.

Lasciolla quivi, gravida, soletta;
tal colpa a tal martiro lui condanna;
e anche di Medea si fa vendetta.

Con lui sen va chi da tal parte inganna;
e questo basti de la prima valle
sapere e di color che ân sÃ© assannaÂ».

GiÃ  eravam lÃ  âve lo stretto calle
con lâargine secondo sâincrocicchia,
e fa di quello ad un altrâ arco spalle.

Quindi sentimmo gente che si nicchia
ne lâaltra bolgia e che col muso scuffa,
e sÃ© medesma con le palme picchia.

Le ripe eran grommate dâuna muffa,
per lâalito di giÃ¹ che vi sâappasta,
che con li occhi e col naso facea zuffa.

Lo fondo Ã¨ cupo sÃ¬, che non ci basta
loco a veder sanza montare al dosso
de lâarco, ove lo scoglio piÃ¹ sovrasta.

Quivi venimmo; e quindi giÃ¹ nel fosso
vidi gente attuffata in uno sterco
che da li uman privadi parea mosso.

E mentre châio lÃ  giÃ¹ con lâocchio cerco,
vidi un col capo sÃ¬ di merda lordo,
che non parÃ«a sâera laico o cherco.

Quei mi sgridÃ²: Â«PerchÃ© seâ tu sÃ¬ gordo
di riguardar piÃ¹ me che li altri brutti?Â».
E io a lui: Â«PerchÃ©, se ben ricordo,

giÃ  tâho veduto coi capelli asciutti,
e seâ Alessio Interminei da Lucca:
perÃ² tâadocchio piÃ¹ che li altri tuttiÂ».

Ed elli allor, battendosi la zucca:
Â«Qua giÃ¹ mâhanno sommerso le lusinghe
ondâ io non ebbi mai la lingua stuccaÂ».

Appresso ciÃ² lo duca Â«Fa che pingheÂ»,
mi disse, Â«il viso un poco piÃ¹ avante,
sÃ¬ che la faccia ben con lâocchio attinghe

di quella sozza e scapigliata fante
che lÃ  si graffia con lâunghie merdose,
e or sâaccoscia e ora Ã¨ in piedi stante.

TaÃ¯de Ã¨, la puttana che rispuose
al drudo suo quando disse âHo io grazie
grandi apo te?â: âAnzi maravigliose!â.

E quinci sian le nostre viste sazieÂ».



Inferno Â· Canto XIX


O Simon mago, o miseri seguaci
che le cose di Dio, che di bontate
deon essere spose, e voi rapaci

per oro e per argento avolterate,
or convien che per voi suoni la tromba,
perÃ² che ne la terza bolgia state.

GiÃ  eravamo, a la seguente tomba,
montati de lo scoglio in quella parte
châa punto sovra mezzo âl fosso piomba.

O somma sapÃ¯enza, quanta Ã¨ lâarte
che mostri in cielo, in terra e nel mal mondo,
e quanto giusto tua virtÃ¹ comparte!

Io vidi per le coste e per lo fondo
piena la pietra livida di fÃ³ri,
dâun largo tutti e ciascun era tondo.

Non mi parean men ampi nÃ© maggiori
che queâ che son nel mio bel San Giovanni,
fatti per loco dâi battezzatori;

lâun de li quali, ancor non Ã¨ moltâ anni,
ruppâ io per un che dentro vâannegava:
e questo sia suggel châognâ omo sganni.

Fuor de la bocca a ciascun soperchiava
dâun peccator li piedi e de le gambe
infino al grosso, e lâaltro dentro stava.

Le piante erano a tutti accese intrambe;
per che sÃ¬ forte guizzavan le giunte,
che spezzate averien ritorte e strambe.

Qual suole il fiammeggiar de le cose unte
muoversi pur su per la strema buccia,
tal era lÃ¬ dai calcagni a le punte.

Â«Chi Ã¨ colui, maestro, che si cruccia
guizzando piÃ¹ che li altri suoi consortiÂ»,
dissâ io, Â«e cui piÃ¹ roggia fiamma succia?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«Se tu vuoâ châiâ ti porti
lÃ  giÃ¹ per quella ripa che piÃ¹ giace,
da lui saprai di sÃ© e deâ suoi tortiÂ».

E io: Â«Tanto mâÃ¨ bel, quanto a te piace:
tu seâ segnore, e sai châiâ non mi parto
dal tuo volere, e sai quel che si taceÂ».

Allor venimmo in su lâargine quarto;
volgemmo e discendemmo a mano stanca
lÃ  giÃ¹ nel fondo foracchiato e arto.

Lo buon maestro ancor de la sua anca
non mi dipuose, sÃ¬ mi giunse al rotto
di quel che si piangeva con la zanca.

Â«O qual che seâ che âl di sÃ¹ tien di sotto,
anima trista come pal commessaÂ»,
cominciaâ io a dir, Â«se puoi, fa mottoÂ».

Io stava come âl frate che confessa
lo perfido assessin, che, poi châÃ¨ fitto,
richiama lui per che la morte cessa.

Ed el gridÃ²: Â«Seâ tu giÃ  costÃ¬ ritto,
seâ tu giÃ  costÃ¬ ritto, Bonifazio?
Di parecchi anni mi mentÃ¬ lo scritto.

Seâ tu sÃ¬ tosto di quellâ aver sazio
per lo qual non temesti tÃ²rre a ânganno
la bella donna, e poi di farne strazio?Â».

Tal mi fecâ io, quai son color che stanno,
per non intender ciÃ² châÃ¨ lor risposto,
quasi scornati, e risponder non sanno.

Allor Virgilio disse: Â«Dilli tosto:
âNon son colui, non son colui che crediâÂ»;
e io rispuosi come a me fu imposto.

Per che lo spirto tutti storse i piedi;
poi, sospirando e con voce di pianto,
mi disse: Â«Dunque che a me richiedi?

Se di saper châiâ sia ti cal cotanto,
che tu abbi perÃ² la ripa corsa,
sappi châiâ fui vestito del gran manto;

e veramente fui figliuol de lâorsa,
cupido sÃ¬ per avanzar li orsatti,
che sÃ¹ lâavere e qui me misi in borsa.

Di sotto al capo mio son li altri tratti
che precedetter me simoneggiando,
per le fessure de la pietra piatti.

LÃ  giÃ¹ cascherÃ² io altresÃ¬ quando
verrÃ  colui châiâ credea che tu fossi,
allor châiâ feci âl sÃ¹bito dimando.

Ma piÃ¹ Ã¨ âl tempo giÃ  che i piÃ¨ mi cossi
e châiâ son stato cosÃ¬ sottosopra,
châel non starÃ  piantato coi piÃ¨ rossi:

chÃ© dopo lui verrÃ  di piÃ¹ laida opra,
di verâ ponente, un pastor sanza legge,
tal che convien che lui e me ricuopra.

Nuovo IasÃ³n sarÃ , di cui si legge
neâ Maccabei; e come a quel fu molle
suo re, cosÃ¬ fia lui chi Francia reggeÂ».

Io non so sâiâ mi fui qui troppo folle,
châiâ pur rispuosi lui a questo metro:
Â«Deh, or mi dÃ¬: quanto tesoro volle

Nostro Segnore in prima da san Pietro
châei ponesse le chiavi in sua balÃ¬a?
Certo non chiese se non âViemmi retroâ.

NÃ© Pier nÃ© li altri tolsero a Matia
oro od argento, quando fu sortito
al loco che perdÃ© lâanima ria.

PerÃ² ti sta, chÃ© tu seâ ben punito;
e guarda ben la mal tolta moneta
châesser ti fece contra Carlo ardito.

E se non fosse châancor lo mi vieta
la reverenza de le somme chiavi
che tu tenesti ne la vita lieta,

io userei parole ancor piÃ¹ gravi;
chÃ© la vostra avarizia il mondo attrista,
calcando i buoni e sollevando i pravi.

Di voi pastor sâaccorse il Vangelista,
quando colei che siede sopra lâacque
puttaneggiar coi regi a lui fu vista;

quella che con le sette teste nacque,
e da le diece corna ebbe argomento,
fin che virtute al suo marito piacque.

Fatto vâavete dio dâoro e dâargento;
e che altro Ã¨ da voi a lâidolatre,
se non châelli uno, e voi ne orate cento?

Ahi, Costantin, di quanto mal fu matre,
non la tua conversion, ma quella dote
che da te prese il primo ricco patre!Â».

E mentrâ io li cantava cotai note,
o ira o coscÃ¯enza che âl mordesse,
forte spingava con ambo le piote.

Iâ credo ben châal mio duca piacesse,
con sÃ¬ contenta labbia sempre attese
lo suon de le parole vere espresse.

PerÃ² con ambo le braccia mi prese;
e poi che tutto su mi sâebbe al petto,
rimontÃ² per la via onde discese.

NÃ© si stancÃ² dâavermi a sÃ© distretto,
sÃ¬ men portÃ² sovra âl colmo de lâarco
che dal quarto al quinto argine Ã¨ tragetto.

Quivi soavemente spuose il carco,
soave per lo scoglio sconcio ed erto
che sarebbe a le capre duro varco.

Indi un altro vallon mi fu scoperto.



Inferno Â· Canto XX


Di nova pena mi conven far versi
e dar matera al ventesimo canto
de la prima canzon, châÃ¨ dâi sommersi.

Io era giÃ  disposto tutto quanto
a riguardar ne lo scoperto fondo,
che si bagnava dâangoscioso pianto;

e vidi gente per lo vallon tondo
venir, tacendo e lagrimando, al passo
che fanno le letane in questo mondo.

Come âl viso mi scese in lor piÃ¹ basso,
mirabilmente apparve esser travolto
ciascun tra âl mento e âl principio del casso,

chÃ© da le reni era tornato âl volto,
e in dietro venir li convenia,
perchÃ© âl veder dinanzi era lor tolto.

Forse per forza giÃ  di parlasia
si travolse cosÃ¬ alcun del tutto;
ma io nol vidi, nÃ© credo che sia.

Se Dio ti lasci, lettor, prender frutto
di tua lezione, or pensa per te stesso
comâ io potea tener lo viso asciutto,

quando la nostra imagine di presso
vidi sÃ¬ torta, che âl pianto de li occhi
le natiche bagnava per lo fesso.

Certo io piangea, poggiato a un deâ rocchi
del duro scoglio, sÃ¬ che la mia scorta
mi disse: Â«Ancor seâ tu de li altri sciocchi?

Qui vive la pietÃ  quandâ Ã¨ ben morta;
chi Ã¨ piÃ¹ scellerato che colui
che al giudicio divin passion comporta?

Drizza la testa, drizza, e vedi a cui
sâaperse a li occhi dâi Teban la terra;
per châei gridavan tutti: âDove rui,

AnfÃ¯arao? perchÃ© lasci la guerra?â.
E non restÃ² di ruinare a valle
fino a MinÃ²s che ciascheduno afferra.

Mira câha fatto petto de le spalle;
perchÃ© volle veder troppo davante,
di retro guarda e fa retroso calle.

Vedi Tiresia, che mutÃ² sembiante
quando di maschio femmina divenne,
cangiandosi le membra tutte quante;

e prima, poi, ribatter li convenne
li duo serpenti avvolti, con la verga,
che rÃ¯avesse le maschili penne.

Aronta Ã¨ quel châal ventre li sâatterga,
che neâ monti di Luni, dove ronca
lo Carrarese che di sotto alberga,

ebbe tra â bianchi marmi la spelonca
per sua dimora; onde a guardar le stelle
e âl mar non li era la veduta tronca.

E quella che ricuopre le mammelle,
che tu non vedi, con le trecce sciolte,
e ha di lÃ  ogne pilosa pelle,

Manto fu, che cercÃ² per terre molte;
poscia si puose lÃ  dove nacquâ io;
onde un poco mi piace che mâascolte.

Poscia che âl padre suo di vita uscÃ¬o
e venne serva la cittÃ  di Baco,
questa gran tempo per lo mondo gio.

Suso in Italia bella giace un laco,
a piÃ¨ de lâAlpe che serra Lamagna
sovra Tiralli, câha nome Benaco.

Per mille fonti, credo, e piÃ¹ si bagna
tra Garda e Val Camonica e Pennino
de lâacqua che nel detto laco stagna.

Loco Ã¨ nel mezzo lÃ  dove âl trentino
pastore e quel di Brescia e âl veronese
segnar poria, sâeâ fesse quel cammino.

Siede Peschiera, bello e forte arnese
da fronteggiar Bresciani e Bergamaschi,
ove la riva ântorno piÃ¹ discese.

Ivi convien che tutto quanto caschi
ciÃ² che ân grembo a Benaco star non puÃ²,
e fassi fiume giÃ¹ per verdi paschi.

Tosto che lâacqua a correr mette co,
non piÃ¹ Benaco, ma Mencio si chiama
fino a Governol, dove cade in Po.

Non molto ha corso, châel trova una lama,
ne la qual si distende e la âmpaluda;
e suol di state talor essere grama.

Quindi passando la vergine cruda
vide terra, nel mezzo del pantano,
sanza coltura e dâabitanti nuda.

LÃ¬, per fuggire ogne consorzio umano,
ristette con suoi servi a far sue arti,
e visse, e vi lasciÃ² suo corpo vano.

Li uomini poi che ântorno erano sparti
sâaccolsero a quel loco, châera forte
per lo pantan châavea da tutte parti.

Fer la cittÃ  sovra quellâ ossa morte;
e per colei che âl loco prima elesse,
MantÃ¼a lâappellar sanzâ altra sorte.

GiÃ  fuor le genti sue dentro piÃ¹ spesse,
prima che la mattia da Casalodi
da Pinamonte inganno ricevesse.

PerÃ² tâassenno che, se tu mai odi
originar la mia terra altrimenti,
la veritÃ  nulla menzogna frodiÂ».

E io: Â«Maestro, i tuoi ragionamenti
mi son sÃ¬ certi e prendon sÃ¬ mia fede,
che li altri mi sarien carboni spenti.

Ma dimmi, de la gente che procede,
se tu ne vedi alcun degno di nota;
chÃ© solo a ciÃ² la mia mente rifiedeÂ».

Allor mi disse: Â«Quel che da la gota
porge la barba in su le spalle brune,
fuâquando Grecia fu di maschi vÃ²ta,

sÃ¬ châa pena rimaser per le cuneâ
augure, e diede âl punto con Calcanta
in Aulide a tagliar la prima fune.

Euripilo ebbe nome, e cosÃ¬ âl canta
lâalta mia tragedÃ¬a in alcun loco:
ben lo sai tu che la sai tutta quanta.

Quellâ altro che neâ fianchi Ã¨ cosÃ¬ poco,
Michele Scotto fu, che veramente
de le magiche frode seppe âl gioco.

Vedi Guido Bonatti; vedi Asdente,
châavere inteso al cuoio e a lo spago
ora vorrebbe, ma tardi si pente.

Vedi le triste che lasciaron lâago,
la spuola e âl fuso, e fecersi ândivine;
fecer malie con erbe e con imago.

Ma vienne omai, chÃ© giÃ  tiene âl confine
dâamendue li emisperi e tocca lâonda
sotto Sobilia Caino e le spine;

e giÃ  iernotte fu la luna tonda:
ben ten deâ ricordar, chÃ© non ti nocque
alcuna volta per la selva fondaÂ».

SÃ¬ mi parlava, e andavamo introcque.



Inferno Â· Canto XXI


CosÃ¬ di ponte in ponte, altro parlando
che la mia comedÃ¬a cantar non cura,
venimmo; e tenavamo âl colmo, quando

restammo per veder lâaltra fessura
di Malebolge e li altri pianti vani;
e vidila mirabilmente oscura.

Quale ne lâarzanÃ  deâ Viniziani
bolle lâinverno la tenace pece
a rimpalmare i legni lor non sani,

chÃ© navicar non ponnoâin quella vece
chi fa suo legno novo e chi ristoppa
le coste a quel che piÃ¹ vÃ¯aggi fece;

chi ribatte da proda e chi da poppa;
altri fa remi e altri volge sarte;
chi terzeruolo e artimon rintoppaâ:

tal, non per foco ma per divinâ arte,
bollia lÃ  giuso una pegola spessa,
che ânviscava la ripa dâogne parte.

Iâ vedea lei, ma non vedÃ«a in essa
mai che le bolle che âl bollor levava,
e gonfiar tutta, e riseder compressa.

Mentrâ io lÃ  giÃ¹ fisamente mirava,
lo duca mio, dicendo Â«Guarda, guarda!Â»,
mi trasse a sÃ© del loco dovâ io stava.

Allor mi volsi come lâuom cui tarda
di veder quel che li convien fuggire
e cui paura sÃ¹bita sgagliarda,

che, per veder, non indugia âl partire:
e vidi dietro a noi un diavol nero
correndo su per lo scoglio venire.

Ahi quantâ elli era ne lâaspetto fero!
e quanto mi parea ne lâatto acerbo,
con lâali aperte e sovra i piÃ¨ leggero!

Lâomero suo, châera aguto e superbo,
carcava un peccator con ambo lâanche,
e quei tenea deâ piÃ¨ ghermito âl nerbo.

Del nostro ponte disse: Â«O Malebranche,
ecco un de li anzÃ¯an di Santa Zita!
Mettetel sotto, châiâ torno per anche

a quella terra, che nâÃ¨ ben fornita:
ognâ uom vâÃ¨ barattier, fuor che Bonturo;
del no, per li denar, vi si fa itaÂ».

LÃ  giÃ¹ âl buttÃ², e per lo scoglio duro
si volse; e mai non fu mastino sciolto
con tanta fretta a seguitar lo furo.

Quel sâattuffÃ², e tornÃ² sÃ¹ convolto;
ma i demon che del ponte avean coperchio,
gridar: Â«Qui non ha loco il Santo Volto!

qui si nuota altrimenti che nel Serchio!
PerÃ², se tu non vuoâ di nostri graffi,
non far sopra la pegola soverchioÂ».

Poi lâaddentar con piÃ¹ di cento raffi,
disser: Â«Coverto convien che qui balli,
sÃ¬ che, se puoi, nascosamente accaffiÂ».

Non altrimenti i cuoci aâ lor vassalli
fanno attuffare in mezzo la caldaia
la carne con li uncin, perchÃ© non galli.

Lo buon maestro Â«AcciÃ² che non si paia
che tu ci siaÂ», mi disse, Â«giÃ¹ tâacquatta
dopo uno scheggio, châalcun schermo tâaia;

e per nulla offension che mi sia fatta,
non temer tu, châiâ ho le cose conte,
perchâ altra volta fui a tal barattaÂ».

Poscia passÃ² di lÃ  dal co del ponte;
e comâ el giunse in su la ripa sesta,
mestier li fu dâaver sicura fronte.

Con quel furore e con quella tempesta
châescono i cani a dosso al poverello
che di sÃ¹bito chiede ove sâarresta,

usciron quei di sotto al ponticello,
e volser contra lui tuttâ i runcigli;
ma el gridÃ²: Â«Nessun di voi sia fello!

Innanzi che lâuncin vostro mi pigli,
traggasi avante lâun di voi che mâoda,
e poi dâarruncigliarmi si consigliÂ».

Tutti gridaron: Â«Vada Malacoda!Â»;
per châun si mosseâe li altri stetter fermiâ
e venne a lui dicendo: Â«Che li approda?Â».

Â«Credi tu, Malacoda, qui vedermi
esser venutoÂ», disse âl mio maestro,
Â«sicuro giÃ  da tutti vostri schermi,

sanza voler divino e fato destro?
Lascianâ andar, chÃ© nel cielo Ã¨ voluto
châiâ mostri altrui questo cammin silvestroÂ».

Allor li fu lâorgoglio sÃ¬ caduto,
châeâ si lasciÃ² cascar lâuncino aâ piedi,
e disse a li altri: Â«Omai non sia ferutoÂ».

E âl duca mio a me: Â«O tu che siedi
tra li scheggion del ponte quatto quatto,
sicuramente omai a me ti riediÂ».

Per châio mi mossi e a lui venni ratto;
e i diavoli si fecer tutti avanti,
sÃ¬ châio temetti châei tenesser patto;

cosÃ¬ vidâ Ã¯o giÃ  temer li fanti
châuscivan patteggiati di Caprona,
veggendo sÃ© tra nemici cotanti.

Iâ mâaccostai con tutta la persona
lungo âl mio duca, e non torceva li occhi
da la sembianza lor châera non buona.

Ei chinavan li raffi e Â«Vuoâ che âl tocchiÂ»,
diceva lâun con lâaltro, Â«in sul groppone?Â».
E rispondien: Â«SÃ¬, fa che glielâ accocchiÂ».

Ma quel demonio che tenea sermone
col duca mio, si volse tutto presto
e disse: Â«Posa, posa, Scarmiglione!Â».

Poi disse a noi: Â«PiÃ¹ oltre andar per questo
iscoglio non si puÃ², perÃ² che giace
tutto spezzato al fondo lâarco sesto.

E se lâandare avante pur vi piace,
andatevene su per questa grotta;
presso Ã¨ un altro scoglio che via face.

Ier, piÃ¹ oltre cinquâ ore che questâ otta,
mille dugento con sessanta sei
anni compiÃ© che qui la via fu rotta.

Io mando verso lÃ  di questi miei
a riguardar sâalcun se ne sciorina;
gite con lor, che non saranno reiÂ».

Â«Traâti avante, Alichino, e CalcabrinaÂ»,
cominciÃ² elli a dire, Â«e tu, Cagnazzo;
e Barbariccia guidi la decina.

Libicocco vegnâ oltre e Draghignazzo,
CirÃ¯atto sannuto e Graffiacane
e Farfarello e Rubicante pazzo.

Cercate ântorno le boglienti pane;
costor sian salvi infino a lâaltro scheggio
che tutto intero va sovra le taneÂ».

Â«OmÃ¨, maestro, che Ã¨ quel châiâ veggio?Â»,
dissâ io, Â«deh, sanza scorta andianci soli,
se tu saâ ir; châiâ per me non la cheggio.

Se tu seâ sÃ¬ accorto come suoli,
non vedi tu châeâ digrignan li denti
e con le ciglia ne minaccian duoli?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«Non voâ che tu paventi;
lasciali digrignar pur a lor senno,
châeâ fanno ciÃ² per li lessi dolentiÂ».

Per lâargine sinistro volta dienno;
ma prima avea ciascun la lingua stretta
coi denti, verso lor duca, per cenno;

ed elli avea del cul fatto trombetta.



Inferno Â· Canto XXII


Io vidi giÃ  cavalier muover campo,
e cominciare stormo e far lor mostra,
e talvolta partir per loro scampo;

corridor vidi per la terra vostra,
o Aretini, e vidi gir gualdane,
fedir torneamenti e correr giostra;

quando con trombe, e quando con campane,
con tamburi e con cenni di castella,
e con cose nostrali e con istrane;

nÃ© giÃ  con sÃ¬ diversa cennamella
cavalier vidi muover nÃ© pedoni,
nÃ© nave a segno di terra o di stella.

Noi andavam con li diece demoni.
Ahi fiera compagnia! ma ne la chiesa
coi santi, e in taverna coi ghiottoni.

Pur a la pegola era la mia ântesa,
per veder de la bolgia ogne contegno
e de la gente châentro vâera incesa.

Come i dalfini, quando fanno segno
aâ marinar con lâarco de la schiena
che sâargomentin di campar lor legno,

talor cosÃ¬, ad alleggiar la pena,
mostravâ alcun deâ peccatori âl dosso
e nascondea in men che non balena.

E come a lâorlo de lâacqua dâun fosso
stanno i ranocchi pur col muso fuori,
sÃ¬ che celano i piedi e lâaltro grosso,

sÃ¬ stavan dâogne parte i peccatori;
ma come sâappressava Barbariccia,
cosÃ¬ si ritraÃ©n sotto i bollori.

Iâ vidi, e anco il cor me nâaccapriccia,
uno aspettar cosÃ¬, comâ elli âncontra
châuna rana rimane e lâaltra spiccia;

e Graffiacan, che li era piÃ¹ di contra,
li arruncigliÃ² le âmpegolate chiome
e trassel sÃ¹, che mi parve una lontra.

Iâ sapea giÃ  di tutti quanti âl nome,
sÃ¬ li notai quando fuorono eletti,
e poi châeâ si chiamaro, attesi come.

Â«O Rubicante, fa che tu li metti
li unghioni a dosso, sÃ¬ che tu lo scuoi!Â»,
gridavan tutti insieme i maladetti.

E io: Â«Maestro mio, fa, se tu puoi,
che tu sappi chi Ã¨ lo sciagurato
venuto a man de li avversari suoiÂ».

Lo duca mio li sâaccostÃ² allato;
domandollo ondâ ei fosse, e quei rispuose:
Â«Iâ fui del regno di Navarra nato.

Mia madre a servo dâun segnor mi puose,
che mâavea generato dâun ribaldo,
distruggitor di sÃ© e di sue cose.

Poi fui famiglia del buon re Tebaldo;
quivi mi misi a far baratteria,
di châio rendo ragione in questo caldoÂ».

E CirÃ¯atto, a cui di bocca uscia
dâogne parte una sanna come a porco,
li fÃ© sentir come lâuna sdruscia.

Tra male gatte era venuto âl sorco;
ma Barbariccia il chiuse con le braccia
e disse: Â«State in lÃ , mentrâ io lo ânforcoÂ».

E al maestro mio volse la faccia;
Â«DomandaÂ», disse, Â«ancor, se piÃ¹ disii
saper da lui, prima châaltri âl disfacciaÂ».

Lo duca dunque: Â«Or dÃ¬: de li altri rii
conosci tu alcun che sia latino
sotto la pece?Â». E quelli: Â«Iâ mi partii,

poco Ã¨, da un che fu di lÃ  vicino.
CosÃ¬ fossâ io ancor con lui coperto,
châiâ non temerei unghia nÃ© uncino!Â».

E Libicocco Â«Troppo avem soffertoÂ»,
disse; e preseli âl braccio col runciglio,
sÃ¬ che, stracciando, ne portÃ² un lacerto.

Draghignazzo anco i volle dar di piglio
giuso a le gambe; onde âl decurio loro
si volse intorno intorno con mal piglio.

Quandâ elli un poco rappaciati fuoro,
a lui, châancor mirava sua ferita,
domandÃ² âl duca mio sanza dimoro:

Â«Chi fu colui da cui mala partita
diâ che facesti per venire a proda?Â».
Ed ei rispuose: Â«Fu frate Gomita,

quel di Gallura, vasel dâogne froda,
châebbe i nemici di suo donno in mano,
e fÃ© sÃ¬ lor, che ciascun se ne loda.

Danar si tolse e lasciolli di piano,
sÃ¬ comâ eâ dice; e ne li altri offici anche
barattier fu non picciol, ma sovrano.

Usa con esso donno Michel Zanche
di Logodoro; e a dir di Sardigna
le lingue lor non si sentono stanche.

OmÃ¨, vedete lâaltro che digrigna;
iâ direi anche, ma iâ temo châello
non sâapparecchi a grattarmi la tignaÂ».

E âl gran proposto, vÃ²lto a Farfarello
che stralunava li occhi per fedire,
disse: Â«Fatti ân costÃ , malvagio uccello!Â».

Â«Se voi volete vedere o udireÂ»,
ricominciÃ² lo spaÃ¼rato appresso,
Â«Toschi o Lombardi, io ne farÃ² venire;

ma stieno i Malebranche un poco in cesso,
sÃ¬ châei non teman de le lor vendette;
e io, seggendo in questo loco stesso,

per un châio son, ne farÃ² venir sette
quandâ io suffolerÃ², comâ Ã¨ nostro uso
di fare allor che fori alcun si metteÂ».

Cagnazzo a cotal motto levÃ² âl muso,
crollando âl capo, e disse: Â«Odi malizia
châelli ha pensata per gittarsi giuso!Â».

Ondâ ei, châavea lacciuoli a gran divizia,
rispuose: Â«Malizioso son io troppo,
quandâ io procuro aâ mia maggior trestiziaÂ».

Alichin non si tenne e, di rintoppo
a li altri, disse a lui: Â«Se tu ti cali,
io non ti verrÃ² dietro di gualoppo,

ma batterÃ² sovra la pece lâali.
Lascisi âl collo, e sia la ripa scudo,
a veder se tu sol piÃ¹ di noi valiÂ».

O tu che leggi, udirai nuovo ludo:
ciascun da lâaltra costa li occhi volse,
quel prima, châa ciÃ² fare era piÃ¹ crudo.

Lo Navarrese ben suo tempo colse;
fermÃ² le piante a terra, e in un punto
saltÃ² e dal proposto lor si sciolse.

Di che ciascun di colpa fu compunto,
ma quei piÃ¹ che cagion fu del difetto;
perÃ² si mosse e gridÃ²: Â«Tu seâ giunto!Â».

Ma poco i valse: chÃ© lâali al sospetto
non potero avanzar; quelli andÃ² sotto,
e quei drizzÃ² volando suso il petto:

non altrimenti lâanitra di botto,
quando âl falcon sâappressa, giÃ¹ sâattuffa,
ed ei ritorna sÃ¹ crucciato e rotto.

Irato Calcabrina de la buffa,
volando dietro li tenne, invaghito
che quei campasse per aver la zuffa;

e come âl barattier fu disparito,
cosÃ¬ volse li artigli al suo compagno,
e fu con lui sopra âl fosso ghermito.

Ma lâaltro fu bene sparvier grifagno
ad artigliar ben lui, e amendue
cadder nel mezzo del bogliente stagno.

Lo caldo sghermitor sÃ¹bito fue;
ma perÃ² di levarsi era neente,
sÃ¬ avieno inviscate lâali sue.

Barbariccia, con li altri suoi dolente,
quattro ne fÃ© volar da lâaltra costa
con tuttâ i raffi, e assai prestamente

di qua, di lÃ  discesero a la posta;
porser li uncini verso li âmpaniati,
châeran giÃ  cotti dentro da la crosta.

E noi lasciammo lor cosÃ¬ âmpacciati.



Inferno Â· Canto XXIII


Taciti, soli, sanza compagnia
nâandavam lâun dinanzi e lâaltro dopo,
come frati minor vanno per via.

VÃ²ltâ era in su la favola dâIsopo
lo mio pensier per la presente rissa,
dovâ el parlÃ² de la rana e del topo;

chÃ© piÃ¹ non si pareggia âmoâ e âissaâ
che lâun con lâaltro fa, se ben sâaccoppia
principio e fine con la mente fissa.

E come lâun pensier de lâaltro scoppia,
cosÃ¬ nacque di quello un altro poi,
che la prima paura mi fÃ© doppia.

Io pensava cosÃ¬: âQuesti per noi
sono scherniti con danno e con beffa
sÃ¬ fatta, châassai credo che lor nÃ²i.

Se lâira sovra âl mal voler sâaggueffa,
ei ne verranno dietro piÃ¹ crudeli
che âl cane a quella lievre châelli acceffaâ.

GiÃ  mi sentia tutti arricciar li peli
de la paura e stava in dietro intento,
quandâ io dissi: Â«Maestro, se non celi

te e me tostamente, iâ ho pavento
dâi Malebranche. Noi li avem giÃ  dietro;
io li âmagino sÃ¬, che giÃ  li sentoÂ».

E quei: Â«Sâiâ fossi di piombato vetro,
lâimagine di fuor tua non trarrei
piÃ¹ tosto a me, che quella dentro âmpetro.

Pur mo venieno i tuoâ pensier tra â miei,
con simile atto e con simile faccia,
sÃ¬ che dâintrambi un sol consiglio fei.

Sâelli Ã¨ che sÃ¬ la destra costa giaccia,
che noi possiam ne lâaltra bolgia scendere,
noi fuggirem lâimaginata cacciaÂ».

GiÃ  non compiÃ© di tal consiglio rendere,
châio li vidi venir con lâali tese
non molto lungi, per volerne prendere.

Lo duca mio di sÃ¹bito mi prese,
come la madre châal romore Ã¨ desta
e vede presso a sÃ© le fiamme accese,

che prende il figlio e fugge e non sâarresta,
avendo piÃ¹ di lui che di sÃ© cura,
tanto che solo una camiscia vesta;

e giÃ¹ dal collo de la ripa dura
supin si diede a la pendente roccia,
che lâun deâ lati a lâaltra bolgia tura.

Non corse mai sÃ¬ tosto acqua per doccia
a volger ruota di molin terragno,
quandâ ella piÃ¹ verso le pale approccia,

come âl maestro mio per quel vivagno,
portandosene me sovra âl suo petto,
come suo figlio, non come compagno.

A pena fuoro i piÃ¨ suoi giunti al letto
del fondo giÃ¹, châeâ furon in sul colle
sovresso noi; ma non lÃ¬ era sospetto:

chÃ© lâalta provedenza che lor volle
porre ministri de la fossa quinta,
poder di partirsâ indi a tutti tolle.

LÃ  giÃ¹ trovammo una gente dipinta
che giva intorno assai con lenti passi,
piangendo e nel sembiante stanca e vinta.

Elli avean cappe con cappucci bassi
dinanzi a li occhi, fatte de la taglia
che in ClugnÃ¬ per li monaci fassi.

Di fuor dorate son, sÃ¬ châelli abbaglia;
ma dentro tutte piombo, e gravi tanto,
che Federigo le mettea di paglia.

Oh in etterno faticoso manto!
Noi ci volgemmo ancor pur a man manca
con loro insieme, intenti al tristo pianto;

ma per lo peso quella gente stanca
venÃ¬a sÃ¬ pian, che noi eravam nuovi
di compagnia ad ogne mover dâanca.

Per châio al duca mio: Â«Fa che tu trovi
alcun châal fatto o al nome si conosca,
e li occhi, sÃ¬ andando, intorno moviÂ».

E un che ântese la parola tosca,
di retro a noi gridÃ²: Â«Tenete i piedi,
voi che correte sÃ¬ per lâaura fosca!

Forse châavrai da me quel che tu chiediÂ».
Onde âl duca si volse e disse: Â«Aspetta,
e poi secondo il suo passo procediÂ».

Ristetti, e vidi due mostrar gran fretta
de lâanimo, col viso, dâesser meco;
ma tardavali âl carco e la via stretta.

Quando fuor giunti, assai con lâocchio bieco
mi rimiraron sanza far parola;
poi si volsero in sÃ©, e dicean seco:

Â«Costui par vivo a lâatto de la gola;
e sâeâ son morti, per qual privilegio
vanno scoperti de la grave stola?Â».

Poi disser me: Â«O Tosco, châal collegio
de lâipocriti tristi seâ venuto,
dir chi tu seâ non avere in dispregioÂ».

E io a loro: Â«Iâ fui nato e cresciuto
sovra âl bel fiume dâArno a la gran villa,
e son col corpo châiâ ho sempre avuto.

Ma voi chi siete, a cui tanto distilla
quantâ iâ veggio dolor giÃ¹ per le guance?
e che pena Ã¨ in voi che sÃ¬ sfavilla?Â».

E lâun rispuose a me: Â«Le cappe rance
son di piombo sÃ¬ grosse, che li pesi
fan cosÃ¬ cigolar le lor bilance.

Frati godenti fummo, e bolognesi;
io Catalano e questi Loderingo
nomati, e da tua terra insieme presi

come suole esser tolto un uom solingo,
per conservar sua pace; e fummo tali,
châancor si pare intorno dal GardingoÂ».

Io cominciai: Â«O frati, i vostri mali . . . Â»;
ma piÃ¹ non dissi, châa lâocchio mi corse
un, crucifisso in terra con tre pali.

Quando mi vide, tutto si distorse,
soffiando ne la barba con sospiri;
e âl frate Catalan, châa ciÃ² sâaccorse,

mi disse: Â«Quel confitto che tu miri,
consigliÃ² i Farisei che convenia
porre un uom per lo popolo aâ martÃ¬ri.

Attraversato Ã¨, nudo, ne la via,
come tu vedi, ed Ã¨ mestier châel senta
qualunque passa, come pesa, pria.

E a tal modo il socero si stenta
in questa fossa, e li altri dal concilio
che fu per li Giudei mala sementaÂ».

Allor vidâ io maravigliar Virgilio
sovra colui châera disteso in croce
tanto vilmente ne lâetterno essilio.

Poscia drizzÃ² al frate cotal voce:
Â«Non vi dispiaccia, se vi lece, dirci
sâa la man destra giace alcuna foce

onde noi amendue possiamo uscirci,
sanza costrigner de li angeli neri
che vegnan dâesto fondo a dipartirciÂ».

Rispuose adunque: Â«PiÃ¹ che tu non speri
sâappressa un sasso che da la gran cerchia
si move e varca tuttâ i vallon feri,

salvo che ân questo Ã¨ rotto e nol coperchia;
montar potrete su per la ruina,
che giace in costa e nel fondo soperchiaÂ».

Lo duca stette un poco a testa china;
poi disse: Â«Mal contava la bisogna
colui che i peccator di qua uncinaÂ».

E âl frate: Â«Io udiâ giÃ  dire a Bologna
del diavol vizi assai, tra â quali udiâ
châelli Ã¨ bugiardo, e padre di menzognaÂ».

Appresso il duca a gran passi sen gÃ¬,
turbato un poco dâira nel sembiante;
ondâ io da li âncarcati mi partiâ

dietro a le poste de le care piante.



Inferno Â· Canto XXIV


In quella parte del giovanetto anno
che âl sole i crin sotto lâAquario tempra
e giÃ  le notti al mezzo dÃ¬ sen vanno,

quando la brina in su la terra assempra
lâimagine di sua sorella bianca,
ma poco dura a la sua penna tempra,

lo villanello a cui la roba manca,
si leva, e guarda, e vede la campagna
biancheggiar tutta; ondâ ei si batte lâanca,

ritorna in casa, e qua e lÃ  si lagna,
come âl tapin che non sa che si faccia;
poi riede, e la speranza ringavagna,

veggendo âl mondo aver cangiata faccia
in poco dâora, e prende suo vincastro
e fuor le pecorelle a pascer caccia.

CosÃ¬ mi fece sbigottir lo mastro
quandâ io li vidi sÃ¬ turbar la fronte,
e cosÃ¬ tosto al mal giunse lo âmpiastro;

chÃ©, come noi venimmo al guasto ponte,
lo duca a me si volse con quel piglio
dolce châio vidi prima a piÃ¨ del monte.

Le braccia aperse, dopo alcun consiglio
eletto seco riguardando prima
ben la ruina, e diedemi di piglio.

E come quei châadopera ed estima,
che sempre par che ânnanzi si proveggia,
cosÃ¬, levando me sÃ¹ verâ la cima

dâun ronchione, avvisava unâaltra scheggia
dicendo: Â«Sovra quella poi tâaggrappa;
ma tenta pria sâÃ¨ tal châella ti reggiaÂ».

Non era via da vestito di cappa,
chÃ© noi a pena, ei lieve e io sospinto,
potavam sÃ¹ montar di chiappa in chiappa.

E se non fosse che da quel precinto
piÃ¹ che da lâaltro era la costa corta,
non so di lui, ma io sarei ben vinto.

Ma perchÃ© Malebolge inverâ la porta
del bassissimo pozzo tutta pende,
lo sito di ciascuna valle porta

che lâuna costa surge e lâaltra scende;
noi pur venimmo al fine in su la punta
onde lâultima pietra si scoscende.

La lena mâera del polmon sÃ¬ munta
quandâ io fui sÃ¹, châiâ non potea piÃ¹ oltre,
anzi mâassisi ne la prima giunta.

Â«Omai convien che tu cosÃ¬ ti spoltreÂ»,
disse âl maestro; Â«chÃ©, seggendo in piuma,
in fama non si vien, nÃ© sotto coltre;

sanza la qual chi sua vita consuma,
cotal vestigio in terra di sÃ© lascia,
qual fummo in aere e in acqua la schiuma.

E perÃ² leva sÃ¹; vinci lâambascia
con lâanimo che vince ogne battaglia,
se col suo grave corpo non sâaccascia.

PiÃ¹ lunga scala convien che si saglia;
non basta da costoro esser partito.
Se tu mi ântendi, or fa sÃ¬ che ti vagliaÂ».

Levaâmi allor, mostrandomi fornito
meglio di lena châiâ non mi sentia,
e dissi: Â«Va, châiâ son forte e arditoÂ».

Su per lo scoglio prendemmo la via,
châera ronchioso, stretto e malagevole,
ed erto piÃ¹ assai che quel di pria.

Parlando andava per non parer fievole;
onde una voce uscÃ¬ de lâaltro fosso,
a parole formar disconvenevole.

Non so che disse, ancor che sovra âl dosso
fossi de lâarco giÃ  che varca quivi;
ma chi parlava ad ire parea mosso.

Io era vÃ²lto in giÃ¹, ma li occhi vivi
non poteano ire al fondo per lo scuro;
per châio: Â«Maestro, fa che tu arrivi

da lâaltro cinghio e dismontiam lo muro;
chÃ©, comâ iâ odo quinci e non intendo,
cosÃ¬ giÃ¹ veggio e neente affiguroÂ».

Â«Altra rispostaÂ», disse, Â«non ti rendo
se non lo far; chÃ© la dimanda onesta
si deâ seguir con lâopera tacendoÂ».

Noi discendemmo il ponte da la testa
dove sâaggiugne con lâottava ripa,
e poi mi fu la bolgia manifesta:

e vidivi entro terribile stipa
di serpenti, e di sÃ¬ diversa mena
che la memoria il sangue ancor mi scipa.

PiÃ¹ non si vanti Libia con sua rena;
chÃ© se chelidri, iaculi e faree
produce, e cencri con anfisibena,

nÃ© tante pestilenzie nÃ© sÃ¬ ree
mostrÃ² giÃ  mai con tutta lâEtÃ¯opia
nÃ© con ciÃ² che di sopra al Mar Rosso Ã¨e.

Tra questa cruda e tristissima copia
corrÃ«an genti nude e spaventate,
sanza sperar pertugio o elitropia:

con serpi le man dietro avean legate;
quelle ficcavan per le ren la coda
e âl capo, ed eran dinanzi aggroppate.

Ed ecco a un châera da nostra proda,
sâavventÃ² un serpente che âl trafisse
lÃ  dove âl collo a le spalle sâannoda.

NÃ© O sÃ¬ tosto mai nÃ© I si scrisse,
comâ el sâaccese e arse, e cener tutto
convenne che cascando divenisse;

e poi che fu a terra sÃ¬ distrutto,
la polver si raccolse per sÃ© stessa
e ân quel medesmo ritornÃ² di butto.

CosÃ¬ per li gran savi si confessa
che la fenice more e poi rinasce,
quando al cinquecentesimo anno appressa;

erba nÃ© biado in sua vita non pasce,
ma sol dâincenso lagrime e dâamomo,
e nardo e mirra son lâultime fasce.

E qual Ã¨ quel che cade, e non sa como,
per forza di demon châa terra il tira,
o dâaltra oppilazion che lega lâomo,

quando si leva, che ântorno si mira
tutto smarrito de la grande angoscia
châelli ha sofferta, e guardando sospira:

tal era âl peccator levato poscia.
Oh potenza di Dio, quantâ Ã¨ severa,
che cotai colpi per vendetta croscia!

Lo duca il domandÃ² poi chi ello era;
per châei rispuose: Â«Io piovvi di Toscana,
poco tempo Ã¨, in questa gola fiera.

Vita bestial mi piacque e non umana,
sÃ¬ come a mul châiâ fui; son Vanni Fucci
bestia, e Pistoia mi fu degna tanaÂ».

E Ã¯o al duca: Â«Dilli che non mucci,
e domanda che colpa qua giÃ¹ âl pinse;
châio âl vidi uomo di sangue e di crucciÂ».

E âl peccator, che ântese, non sâinfinse,
ma drizzÃ² verso me lâanimo e âl volto,
e di trista vergogna si dipinse;

poi disse: Â«PiÃ¹ mi duol che tu mâhai colto
ne la miseria dove tu mi vedi,
che quando fui de lâaltra vita tolto.

Io non posso negar quel che tu chiedi;
in giÃ¹ son messo tanto perchâ io fui
ladro a la sagrestia dâi belli arredi,

e falsamente giÃ  fu apposto altrui.
Ma perchÃ© di tal vista tu non godi,
se mai sarai di fuor daâ luoghi bui,

apri li orecchi al mio annunzio, e odi.
Pistoia in pria dâi Neri si dimagra;
poi Fiorenza rinova gente e modi.

Tragge Marte vapor di Val di Magra
châÃ¨ di torbidi nuvoli involuto;
e con tempesta impetÃ¼osa e agra

sovra Campo Picen fia combattuto;
ondâ ei repente spezzerÃ  la nebbia,
sÃ¬ châogne Bianco ne sarÃ  feruto.

E detto lâho perchÃ© doler ti debbia!Â».



Inferno Â· Canto XXV


Al fine de le sue parole il ladro
le mani alzÃ² con amendue le fiche,
gridando: Â«Togli, Dio, châa te le squadro!Â».

Da indi in qua mi fuor le serpi amiche,
perchâ una li sâavvolse allora al collo,
come dicesse âNon voâ che piÃ¹ dicheâ;

e unâaltra a le braccia, e rilegollo,
ribadendo sÃ© stessa sÃ¬ dinanzi,
che non potea con esse dare un crollo.

Ahi Pistoia, Pistoia, chÃ© non stanzi
dâincenerarti sÃ¬ che piÃ¹ non duri,
poi che ân mal fare il seme tuo avanzi?

Per tuttâ i cerchi de lo ânferno scuri
non vidi spirto in Dio tanto superbo,
non quel che cadde a Tebe giÃ¹ daâ muri.

El si fuggÃ¬ che non parlÃ² piÃ¹ verbo;
e io vidi un centauro pien di rabbia
venir chiamando: Â«Ovâ Ã¨, ovâ Ã¨ lâacerbo?Â».

Maremma non credâ io che tante nâabbia,
quante bisce elli avea su per la groppa
infin ove comincia nostra labbia.

Sovra le spalle, dietro da la coppa,
con lâali aperte li giacea un draco;
e quello affuoca qualunque sâintoppa.

Lo mio maestro disse: Â«Questi Ã¨ Caco,
che, sotto âl sasso di monte Aventino,
di sangue fece spesse volte laco.

Non va coâ suoi fratei per un cammino,
per lo furto che frodolente fece
del grande armento châelli ebbe a vicino;

onde cessar le sue opere biece
sotto la mazza dâErcule, che forse
gliene diÃ¨ cento, e non sentÃ¬ le dieceÂ».

Mentre che sÃ¬ parlava, ed el trascorse,
e tre spiriti venner sotto noi,
deâ quai nÃ© io nÃ© âl duca mio sâaccorse,

se non quando gridar: Â«Chi siete voi?Â»;
per che nostra novella si ristette,
e intendemmo pur ad essi poi.

Io non li conoscea; ma ei seguette,
come suol seguitar per alcun caso,
che lâun nomar un altro convenette,

dicendo: Â«Cianfa dove fia rimaso?Â»;
per châio, acciÃ² che âl duca stesse attento,
mi puosi âl dito su dal mento al naso.

Se tu seâ or, lettore, a creder lento
ciÃ² châio dirÃ², non sarÃ  maraviglia,
chÃ© io che âl vidi, a pena il mi consento.

Comâ io tenea levate in lor le ciglia,
e un serpente con sei piÃ¨ si lancia
dinanzi a lâuno, e tutto a lui sâappiglia.

Coâ piÃ¨ di mezzo li avvinse la pancia
e con li anterÃ¯or le braccia prese;
poi li addentÃ² e lâuna e lâaltra guancia;

li diretani a le cosce distese,
e miseli la coda tra âmbedue
e dietro per le ren sÃ¹ la ritese.

Ellera abbarbicata mai non fue
ad alber sÃ¬, come lâorribil fiera
per lâaltrui membra avviticchiÃ² le sue.

Poi sâappiccar, come di calda cera
fossero stati, e mischiar lor colore,
nÃ© lâun nÃ© lâaltro giÃ  parea quel châera:

come procede innanzi da lâardore,
per lo papiro suso, un color bruno
che non Ã¨ nero ancora e âl bianco more.

Li altri due âl riguardavano, e ciascuno
gridava: Â«OmÃ¨, Agnel, come ti muti!
Vedi che giÃ  non seâ nÃ© due nÃ© unoÂ».

GiÃ  eran li due capi un divenuti,
quando nâapparver due figure miste
in una faccia, ovâ eran due perduti.

Fersi le braccia due di quattro liste;
le cosce con le gambe e âl ventre e âl casso
divenner membra che non fuor mai viste.

Ogne primaio aspetto ivi era casso:
due e nessun lâimagine perversa
parea; e tal sen gio con lento passo.

Come âl ramarro sotto la gran fersa
dei dÃ¬ canicular, cangiando sepe,
folgore par se la via attraversa,

sÃ¬ pareva, venendo verso lâepe
de li altri due, un serpentello acceso,
livido e nero come gran di pepe;

e quella parte onde prima Ã¨ preso
nostro alimento, a lâun di lor trafisse;
poi cadde giuso innanzi lui disteso.

Lo trafitto âl mirÃ², ma nulla disse;
anzi, coâ piÃ¨ fermati, sbadigliava
pur come sonno o febbre lâassalisse.

Elli âl serpente e quei lui riguardava;
lâun per la piaga e lâaltro per la bocca
fummavan forte, e âl fummo si scontrava.

Taccia Lucano ormai lÃ  dovâ eâ tocca
del misero Sabello e di Nasidio,
e attenda a udir quel châor si scocca.

Taccia di Cadmo e dâAretusa Ovidio,
chÃ© se quello in serpente e quella in fonte
converte poetando, io non lo ânvidio;

chÃ© due nature mai a fronte a fronte
non trasmutÃ² sÃ¬ châamendue le forme
a cambiar lor matera fosser pronte.

Insieme si rispuosero a tai norme,
che âl serpente la coda in forca fesse,
e âl feruto ristrinse insieme lâorme.

Le gambe con le cosce seco stesse
sâappiccar sÃ¬, che ân poco la giuntura
non facea segno alcun che si paresse.

Togliea la coda fessa la figura
che si perdeva lÃ , e la sua pelle
si facea molle, e quella di lÃ  dura.

Io vidi intrar le braccia per lâascelle,
e i due piÃ¨ de la fiera, châeran corti,
tanto allungar quanto accorciavan quelle.

Poscia li piÃ¨ di rietro, insieme attorti,
diventaron lo membro che lâuom cela,
e âl misero del suo nâavea due porti.

Mentre che âl fummo lâuno e lâaltro vela
di color novo, e genera âl pel suso
per lâuna parte e da lâaltra il dipela,

lâun si levÃ² e lâaltro cadde giuso,
non torcendo perÃ² le lucerne empie,
sotto le quai ciascun cambiava muso.

Quel châera dritto, il trasse verâ le tempie,
e di troppa matera châin lÃ  venne
uscir li orecchi de le gote scempie;

ciÃ² che non corse in dietro e si ritenne
di quel soverchio, fÃ© naso a la faccia
e le labbra ingrossÃ² quanto convenne.

Quel che giacÃ«a, il muso innanzi caccia,
e li orecchi ritira per la testa
come face le corna la lumaccia;

e la lingua, châavÃ«a unita e presta
prima a parlar, si fende, e la forcuta
ne lâaltro si richiude; e âl fummo resta.

Lâanima châera fiera divenuta,
suffolando si fugge per la valle,
e lâaltro dietro a lui parlando sputa.

Poscia li volse le novelle spalle,
e disse a lâaltro: Â«Iâ voâ che Buoso corra,
comâ ho fattâ io, carpon per questo calleÂ».

CosÃ¬ vidâ io la settima zavorra
mutare e trasmutare; e qui mi scusi
la novitÃ  se fior la penna abborra.

E avvegna che li occhi miei confusi
fossero alquanto e lâanimo smagato,
non poter quei fuggirsi tanto chiusi,

châiâ non scorgessi ben Puccio Sciancato;
ed era quel che sol, di tre compagni
che venner prima, non era mutato;

lâaltrâ era quel che tu, Gaville, piagni.



Inferno Â· Canto XXVI


Godi, Fiorenza, poi che seâ sÃ¬ grande
che per mare e per terra batti lâali,
e per lo ânferno tuo nome si spande!

Tra li ladron trovai cinque cotali
tuoi cittadini onde mi ven vergogna,
e tu in grande orranza non ne sali.

Ma se presso al mattin del ver si sogna,
tu sentirai, di qua da picciol tempo,
di quel che Prato, non châaltri, tâagogna.

E se giÃ  fosse, non saria per tempo.
CosÃ¬ fossâ ei, da che pur esser dee!
chÃ© piÃ¹ mi graverÃ , comâ piÃ¹ mâattempo.

Noi ci partimmo, e su per le scalee
che nâavea fatto iborni a scender pria,
rimontÃ² âl duca mio e trasse mee;

e proseguendo la solinga via,
tra le schegge e tra â rocchi de lo scoglio
lo piÃ¨ sanza la man non si spedia.

Allor mi dolsi, e ora mi ridoglio
quando drizzo la mente a ciÃ² châio vidi,
e piÃ¹ lo ângegno affreno châiâ non soglio,

perchÃ© non corra che virtÃ¹ nol guidi;
sÃ¬ che, se stella bona o miglior cosa
mâha dato âl ben, châio stessi nol mâinvidi.

Quante âl villan châal poggio si riposa,
nel tempo che colui che âl mondo schiara
la faccia sua a noi tien meno ascosa,

come la mosca cede a la zanzara,
vede lucciole giÃ¹ per la vallea,
forse colÃ  dovâ eâ vendemmia e ara:

di tante fiamme tutta risplendea
lâottava bolgia, sÃ¬ comâ io mâaccorsi
tosto che fui lÃ  âve âl fondo parea.

E qual colui che si vengiÃ² con li orsi
vide âl carro dâElia al dipartire,
quando i cavalli al cielo erti levorsi,

che nol potea sÃ¬ con li occhi seguire,
châel vedesse altro che la fiamma sola,
sÃ¬ come nuvoletta, in sÃ¹ salire:

tal si move ciascuna per la gola
del fosso, chÃ© nessuna mostra âl furto,
e ogne fiamma un peccatore invola.

Io stava sovra âl ponte a veder surto,
sÃ¬ che sâio non avessi un ronchion preso,
caduto sarei giÃ¹ sanzâ esser urto.

E âl duca che mi vide tanto atteso,
disse: Â«Dentro dai fuochi son li spirti;
catun si fascia di quel châelli Ã¨ incesoÂ».

Â«Maestro mioÂ», rispuosâ io, Â«per udirti
son io piÃ¹ certo; ma giÃ  mâera avviso
che cosÃ¬ fosse, e giÃ  voleva dirti:

chi Ã¨ ân quel foco che vien sÃ¬ diviso
di sopra, che par surger de la pira
dovâ EteÃ²cle col fratel fu miso?Â».

Rispuose a me: Â«LÃ  dentro si martira
Ulisse e DÃ¯omede, e cosÃ¬ insieme
a la vendetta vanno come a lâira;

e dentro da la lor fiamma si geme
lâagguato del caval che fÃ© la porta
onde uscÃ¬ deâ Romani il gentil seme.

Piangevisi entro lâarte per che, morta,
DeÃ¯damÃ¬a ancor si duol dâAchille,
e del Palladio pena vi si portaÂ».

Â«Sâei posson dentro da quelle faville
parlarÂ», dissâ io, Â«maestro, assai ten priego
e ripriego, che âl priego vaglia mille,

che non mi facci de lâattender niego
fin che la fiamma cornuta qua vegna;
vedi che del disio verâ lei mi piego!Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«La tua preghiera Ã¨ degna
di molta loda, e io perÃ² lâaccetto;
ma fa che la tua lingua si sostegna.

Lascia parlare a me, châiâ ho concetto
ciÃ² che tu vuoi; châei sarebbero schivi,
perchâ eâ fuor greci, forse del tuo dettoÂ».

Poi che la fiamma fu venuta quivi
dove parve al mio duca tempo e loco,
in questa forma lui parlare audivi:

Â«O voi che siete due dentro ad un foco,
sâio meritai di voi mentre châio vissi,
sâio meritai di voi assai o poco

quando nel mondo li alti versi scrissi,
non vi movete; ma lâun di voi dica
dove, per lui, perduto a morir gissiÂ».

Lo maggior corno de la fiamma antica
cominciÃ² a crollarsi mormorando,
pur come quella cui vento affatica;

indi la cima qua e lÃ  menando,
come fosse la lingua che parlasse,
gittÃ² voce di fuori e disse: Â«Quando

mi dipartiâ da Circe, che sottrasse
me piÃ¹ dâun anno lÃ  presso a Gaeta,
prima che sÃ¬ EnÃ«a la nomasse,

nÃ© dolcezza di figlio, nÃ© la pieta
del vecchio padre, nÃ© âl debito amore
lo qual dovea PenelopÃ¨ far lieta,

vincer potero dentro a me lâardore
châiâ ebbi a divenir del mondo esperto
e de li vizi umani e del valore;

ma misi me per lâalto mare aperto
sol con un legno e con quella compagna
picciola da la qual non fui diserto.

Lâun lito e lâaltro vidi infin la Spagna,
fin nel Morrocco, e lâisola dâi Sardi,
e lâaltre che quel mare intorno bagna.

Io e â compagni eravam vecchi e tardi
quando venimmo a quella foce stretta
dovâ Ercule segnÃ² li suoi riguardi

acciÃ² che lâuom piÃ¹ oltre non si metta;
da la man destra mi lasciai Sibilia,
da lâaltra giÃ  mâavea lasciata Setta.

âO fratiâ, dissi âche per cento milia
perigli siete giunti a lâoccidente,
a questa tanto picciola vigilia

dâi nostri sensi châÃ¨ del rimanente
non vogliate negar lâesperÃ¯enza,
di retro al sol, del mondo sanza gente.

Considerate la vostra semenza:
fatti non foste a viver come bruti,
ma per seguir virtute e canoscenzaâ.

Li miei compagni fecâ io sÃ¬ aguti,
con questa orazion picciola, al cammino,
che a pena poscia li avrei ritenuti;

e volta nostra poppa nel mattino,
deâ remi facemmo ali al folle volo,
sempre acquistando dal lato mancino.

Tutte le stelle giÃ  de lâaltro polo
vedea la notte, e âl nostro tanto basso,
che non surgÃ«a fuor del marin suolo.

Cinque volte racceso e tante casso
lo lume era di sotto da la luna,
poi che ântrati eravam ne lâalto passo,

quando nâapparve una montagna, bruna
per la distanza, e parvemi alta tanto
quanto veduta non avÃ«a alcuna.

Noi ci allegrammo, e tosto tornÃ² in pianto;
chÃ© de la nova terra un turbo nacque
e percosse del legno il primo canto.

Tre volte il fÃ© girar con tutte lâacque;
a la quarta levar la poppa in suso
e la prora ire in giÃ¹, comâ altrui piacque,

infin che âl mar fu sovra noi richiusoÂ».



Inferno Â· Canto XXVII


GiÃ  era dritta in sÃ¹ la fiamma e queta
per non dir piÃ¹, e giÃ  da noi sen gia
con la licenza del dolce poeta,

quandâ unâaltra, che dietro a lei venÃ¬a,
ne fece volger li occhi a la sua cima
per un confuso suon che fuor nâuscia.

Come âl bue cicilian che mugghiÃ² prima
col pianto di colui, e ciÃ² fu dritto,
che lâavea temperato con sua lima,

mugghiava con la voce de lâafflitto,
sÃ¬ che, con tutto che fosse di rame,
pur el pareva dal dolor trafitto;

cosÃ¬, per non aver via nÃ© forame
dal principio nel foco, in suo linguaggio
si convertÃ¯an le parole grame.

Ma poscia châebber colto lor vÃ¯aggio
su per la punta, dandole quel guizzo
che dato avea la lingua in lor passaggio,

udimmo dire: Â«O tu a cuâ io drizzo
la voce e che parlavi mo lombardo,
dicendo âIstra ten va, piÃ¹ non tâadizzoâ,

perchâ io sia giunto forse alquanto tardo,
non tâincresca restare a parlar meco;
vedi che non incresce a me, e ardo!

Se tu pur mo in questo mondo cieco
caduto seâ di quella dolce terra
latina ondâ io mia colpa tutta reco,

dimmi se Romagnuoli han pace o guerra;
châio fui dâi monti lÃ  intra Orbino
e âl giogo di che Tever si diserraÂ».

Io era in giuso ancora attento e chino,
quando il mio duca mi tentÃ² di costa,
dicendo: Â«Parla tu; questi Ã¨ latinoÂ».

E io, châavea giÃ  pronta la risposta,
sanza indugio a parlare incominciai:
Â«O anima che seâ lÃ  giÃ¹ nascosta,

Romagna tua non Ã¨, e non fu mai,
sanza guerra neâ cuor deâ suoi tiranni;
ma ân palese nessuna or vi lasciai.

Ravenna sta come stata Ã¨ moltâ anni:
lâaguglia da Polenta la si cova,
sÃ¬ che Cervia ricuopre coâ suoi vanni.

La terra che fÃ© giÃ  la lunga prova
e di Franceschi sanguinoso mucchio,
sotto le branche verdi si ritrova.

E âl mastin vecchio e âl nuovo da Verrucchio,
che fecer di Montagna il mal governo,
lÃ  dove soglion fan dâi denti succhio.

Le cittÃ  di Lamone e di Santerno
conduce il lÃ¯oncel dal nido bianco,
che muta parte da la state al verno.

E quella cuâ il Savio bagna il fianco,
cosÃ¬ comâ ella sieâ tra âl piano e âl monte,
tra tirannia si vive e stato franco.

Ora chi seâ, ti priego che ne conte;
non esser duro piÃ¹ châaltri sia stato,
se âl nome tuo nel mondo tegna fronteÂ».

Poscia che âl foco alquanto ebbe rugghiato
al modo suo, lâaguta punta mosse
di qua, di lÃ , e poi diÃ¨ cotal fiato:

Â«Sâiâ credesse che mia risposta fosse
a persona che mai tornasse al mondo,
questa fiamma staria sanza piÃ¹ scosse;

ma perÃ² che giÃ  mai di questo fondo
non tornÃ² vivo alcun, sâiâ odo il vero,
sanza tema dâinfamia ti rispondo.

Io fui uom dâarme, e poi fui cordigliero,
credendomi, sÃ¬ cinto, fare ammenda;
e certo il creder mio venÃ¬a intero,

se non fosse il gran prete, a cui mal prenda!,
che mi rimise ne le prime colpe;
e come e quare, voglio che mâintenda.

Mentre châio forma fui dâossa e di polpe
che la madre mi diÃ¨, lâopere mie
non furon leonine, ma di volpe.

Li accorgimenti e le coperte vie
io seppi tutte, e sÃ¬ menai lor arte,
châal fine de la terra il suono uscie.

Quando mi vidi giunto in quella parte
di mia etade ove ciascun dovrebbe
calar le vele e raccoglier le sarte,

ciÃ² che pria mi piacÃ«a, allor mâincrebbe,
e pentuto e confesso mi rendei;
ahi miser lasso! e giovato sarebbe.

Lo principe dâi novi Farisei,
avendo guerra presso a Laterano,
e non con Saracin nÃ© con Giudei,

chÃ© ciascun suo nimico era cristiano,
e nessun era stato a vincer Acri
nÃ© mercatante in terra di Soldano,

nÃ© sommo officio nÃ© ordini sacri
guardÃ² in sÃ©, nÃ© in me quel capestro
che solea fare i suoi cinti piÃ¹ macri.

Ma come Costantin chiese Silvestro
dâentro Siratti a guerir de la lebbre,
cosÃ¬ mi chiese questi per maestro

a guerir de la sua superba febbre;
domandommi consiglio, e io tacetti
perchÃ© le sue parole parver ebbre.

Eâ poi ridisse: âTuo cuor non sospetti;
finor tâassolvo, e tu mâinsegna fare
sÃ¬ come Penestrino in terra getti.

Lo ciel possâ io serrare e diserrare,
come tu sai; perÃ² son due le chiavi
che âl mio antecessor non ebbe careâ.

Allor mi pinser li argomenti gravi
lÃ  âve âl tacer mi fu avviso âl peggio,
e dissi: âPadre, da che tu mi lavi

di quel peccato ovâ io mo cader deggio,
lunga promessa con lâattender corto
ti farÃ  trÃ¯unfar ne lâalto seggioâ.

Francesco venne poi, comâ io fuâ morto,
per me; ma un dâi neri cherubini
li disse: âNon portar: non mi far torto.

Venir se ne dee giÃ¹ tra â miei meschini
perchÃ© diede âl consiglio frodolente,
dal quale in qua stato li sono aâ crini;

châassolver non si puÃ² chi non si pente,
nÃ© pentere e volere insieme puossi
per la contradizion che nol consenteâ.

Oh me dolente! come mi riscossi
quando mi prese dicendomi: âForse
tu non pensavi châio lÃ¶ico fossi!â.

A MinÃ²s mi portÃ²; e quelli attorse
otto volte la coda al dosso duro;
e poi che per gran rabbia la si morse,

disse: âQuesti Ã¨ dâi rei del foco furoâ;
per châio lÃ  dove vedi son perduto,
e sÃ¬ vestito, andando, mi rancuroÂ».

Quandâ elli ebbe âl suo dir cosÃ¬ compiuto,
la fiamma dolorando si partio,
torcendo e dibattendo âl corno aguto.

Noi passammâ oltre, e io e âl duca mio,
su per lo scoglio infino in su lâaltrâ arco
che cuopre âl fosso in che si paga il fio

a quei che scommettendo acquistan carco.



Inferno Â· Canto XXVIII


Chi poria mai pur con parole sciolte
dicer del sangue e de le piaghe a pieno
châiâ ora vidi, per narrar piÃ¹ volte?

Ogne lingua per certo verria meno
per lo nostro sermone e per la mente
câhanno a tanto comprender poco seno.

Sâel sâaunasse ancor tutta la gente
che giÃ , in su la fortunata terra
di Puglia, fu del suo sangue dolente

per li Troiani e per la lunga guerra
che de lâanella fÃ© sÃ¬ alte spoglie,
come LivÃ¯o scrive, che non erra,

con quella che sentio di colpi doglie
per contastare a Ruberto Guiscardo;
e lâaltra il cui ossame ancor sâaccoglie

a Ceperan, lÃ  dove fu bugiardo
ciascun Pugliese, e lÃ  da Tagliacozzo,
dove sanzâ arme vinse il vecchio Alardo;

e qual forato suo membro e qual mozzo
mostrasse, dâaequar sarebbe nulla
il modo de la nona bolgia sozzo.

GiÃ  veggia, per mezzul perdere o lulla,
comâ io vidi un, cosÃ¬ non si pertugia,
rotto dal mento infin dove si trulla.

Tra le gambe pendevan le minugia;
la corata pareva e âl tristo sacco
che merda fa di quel che si trangugia.

Mentre che tutto in lui veder mâattacco,
guardommi e con le man sâaperse il petto,
dicendo: Â«Or vedi comâ io mi dilacco!

vedi come storpiato Ã¨ MÃ¤ometto!
Dinanzi a me sen va piangendo AlÃ¬,
fesso nel volto dal mento al ciuffetto.

E tutti li altri che tu vedi qui,
seminator di scandalo e di scisma
fuor vivi, e perÃ² son fessi cosÃ¬.

Un diavolo Ã¨ qua dietro che nâaccisma
sÃ¬ crudelmente, al taglio de la spada
rimettendo ciascun di questa risma,

quandâ avem volta la dolente strada;
perÃ² che le ferite son richiuse
prima châaltri dinanzi li rivada.

Ma tu chi seâ che ân su lo scoglio muse,
forse per indugiar dâire a la pena
châÃ¨ giudicata in su le tue accuse?Â».

Â«NÃ© morte âl giunse ancor, nÃ© colpa âl menaÂ»,
rispuose âl mio maestro, Â«a tormentarlo;
ma per dar lui esperÃ¯enza piena,

a me, che morto son, convien menarlo
per lo ânferno qua giÃ¹ di giro in giro;
e questâ Ã¨ ver cosÃ¬ comâ io ti parloÂ».

PiÃ¹ fuor di cento che, quando lâudiro,
sâarrestaron nel fosso a riguardarmi
per maraviglia, oblÃ¯ando il martiro.

Â«Or dÃ¬ a fra Dolcin dunque che sâarmi,
tu che forse vedraâ il sole in breve,
sâello non vuol qui tosto seguitarmi,

sÃ¬ di vivanda, che stretta di neve
non rechi la vittoria al Noarese,
châaltrimenti acquistar non saria leveÂ».

Poi che lâun piÃ¨ per girsene sospese,
MÃ¤ometto mi disse esta parola;
indi a partirsi in terra lo distese.

Un altro, che forata avea la gola
e tronco âl naso infin sotto le ciglia,
e non avea mai châuna orecchia sola,

ristato a riguardar per maraviglia
con li altri, innanzi a li altri aprÃ¬ la canna,
châera di fuor dâogne parte vermiglia,

e disse: Â«O tu cui colpa non condanna
e cuâ io vidi su in terra latina,
se troppa simiglianza non mâinganna,

rimembriti di Pier da Medicina,
se mai torni a veder lo dolce piano
che da Vercelli a MarcabÃ² dichina.

E fa saper aâ due miglior da Fano,
a messer Guido e anco ad Angiolello,
che, se lâantiveder qui non Ã¨ vano,

gittati saran fuor di lor vasello
e mazzerati presso a la Cattolica
per tradimento dâun tiranno fello.

Tra lâisola di Cipri e di Maiolica
non vide mai sÃ¬ gran fallo Nettuno,
non da pirate, non da gente argolica.

Quel traditor che vede pur con lâuno,
e tien la terra che tale qui meco
vorrebbe di vedere esser digiuno,

farÃ  venirli a parlamento seco;
poi farÃ  sÃ¬, châal vento di Focara
non sarÃ  lor mestier voto nÃ© precoÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Dimostrami e dichiara,
se vuoâ châiâ porti sÃ¹ di te novella,
chi Ã¨ colui da la veduta amaraÂ».

Allor puose la mano a la mascella
dâun suo compagno e la bocca li aperse,
gridando: Â«Questi Ã¨ desso, e non favella.

Questi, scacciato, il dubitar sommerse
in Cesare, affermando che âl fornito
sempre con danno lâattender sofferseÂ».

Oh quanto mi pareva sbigottito
con la lingua tagliata ne la strozza
CurÃ¯o, châa dir fu cosÃ¬ ardito!

E un châavea lâuna e lâaltra man mozza,
levando i moncherin per lâaura fosca,
sÃ¬ che âl sangue facea la faccia sozza,

gridÃ²: Â«Ricorderaâti anche del Mosca,
che disse, lasso!, âCapo ha cosa fattaâ,
che fu mal seme per la gente toscaÂ».

E io li aggiunsi: Â«E morte di tua schiattaÂ»;
per châelli, accumulando duol con duolo,
sen gio come persona trista e matta.

Ma io rimasi a riguardar lo stuolo,
e vidi cosa châio avrei paura,
sanza piÃ¹ prova, di contarla solo;

se non che coscÃ¯enza mâassicura,
la buona compagnia che lâuom francheggia
sotto lâasbergo del sentirsi pura.

Io vidi certo, e ancor par châio âl veggia,
un busto sanza capo andar sÃ¬ come
andavan li altri de la trista greggia;

e âl capo tronco tenea per le chiome,
pesol con mano a guisa di lanterna:
e quel mirava noi e dicea: Â«Oh me!Â».

Di sÃ© facea a sÃ© stesso lucerna,
ed eran due in uno e uno in due;
comâ esser puÃ², quei sa che sÃ¬ governa.

Quando diritto al piÃ¨ del ponte fue,
levÃ² âl braccio alto con tutta la testa
per appressarne le parole sue,

che fuoro: Â«Or vedi la pena molesta,
tu che, spirando, vai veggendo i morti:
vedi sâalcuna Ã¨ grande come questa.

E perchÃ© tu di me novella porti,
sappi châiâ son Bertram dal Bornio, quelli
che diedi al re giovane i maâ conforti.

Io feci il padre e âl figlio in sÃ© ribelli;
AchitofÃ¨l non fÃ© piÃ¹ dâAbsalone
e di DavÃ¬d coi malvagi punzelli.

Perchâ io partiâ cosÃ¬ giunte persone,
partito porto il mio cerebro, lasso!,
dal suo principio châÃ¨ in questo troncone.

CosÃ¬ sâosserva in me lo contrapassoÂ».



Inferno Â· Canto XXIX


La molta gente e le diverse piaghe
avean le luci mie sÃ¬ inebrÃ¯ate,
che de lo stare a piangere eran vaghe.

Ma Virgilio mi disse: Â«Che pur guate?
perchÃ© la vista tua pur si soffolge
lÃ  giÃ¹ tra lâombre triste smozzicate?

Tu non hai fatto sÃ¬ a lâaltre bolge;
pensa, se tu annoverar le credi,
che miglia ventidue la valle volge.

E giÃ  la luna Ã¨ sotto i nostri piedi;
lo tempo Ã¨ poco omai che nâÃ¨ concesso,
e altro Ã¨ da veder che tu non vediÂ».

Â«Se tu avessiÂ», rispuosâ io appresso,
Â«atteso a la cagion per châio guardava,
forse mâavresti ancor lo star dimessoÂ».

Parte sen giva, e io retro li andava,
lo duca, giÃ  faccendo la risposta,
e soggiugnendo: Â«Dentro a quella cava

dovâ io tenea or li occhi sÃ¬ a posta,
credo châun spirto del mio sangue pianga
la colpa che lÃ  giÃ¹ cotanto costaÂ».

Allor disse âl maestro: Â«Non si franga
lo tuo pensier da qui innanzi sovrâ ello.
Attendi ad altro, ed ei lÃ  si rimanga;

châio vidi lui a piÃ¨ del ponticello
mostrarti e minacciar forte col dito,
e udiâ âl nominar Geri del Bello.

Tu eri allor sÃ¬ del tutto impedito
sovra colui che giÃ  tenne Altaforte,
che non guardasti in lÃ , sÃ¬ fu partitoÂ».

Â«O duca mio, la vÃ¯olenta morte
che non li Ã¨ vendicata ancorÂ», dissâ io,
Â«per alcun che de lâonta sia consorte,

fece lui disdegnoso; ondâ el sen gio
sanza parlarmi, sÃ¬ comâ Ã¯o estimo:
e in ciÃ² mâha el fatto a sÃ© piÃ¹ pioÂ».

CosÃ¬ parlammo infino al loco primo
che de lo scoglio lâaltra valle mostra,
se piÃ¹ lume vi fosse, tutto ad imo.

Quando noi fummo sor lâultima chiostra
di Malebolge, sÃ¬ che i suoi conversi
potean parere a la veduta nostra,

lamenti saettaron me diversi,
che di pietÃ  ferrati avean li strali;
ondâ io li orecchi con le man copersi.

Qual dolor fora, se de li spedali
di Valdichiana tra âl luglio e âl settembre
e di Maremma e di Sardigna i mali

fossero in una fossa tutti ânsembre,
tal era quivi, e tal puzzo nâusciva
qual suol venir de le marcite membre.

Noi discendemmo in su lâultima riva
del lungo scoglio, pur da man sinistra;
e allor fu la mia vista piÃ¹ viva

giÃ¹ verâ lo fondo, la âve la ministra
de lâalto Sire infallibil giustizia
punisce i falsador che qui registra.

Non credo châa veder maggior tristizia
fosse in Egina il popol tutto infermo,
quando fu lâaere sÃ¬ pien di malizia,

che li animali, infino al picciol vermo,
cascaron tutti, e poi le genti antiche,
secondo che i poeti hanno per fermo,

si ristorar di seme di formiche;
châera a veder per quella oscura valle
languir li spirti per diverse biche.

Qual sovra âl ventre e qual sovra le spalle
lâun de lâaltro giacea, e qual carpone
si trasmutava per lo tristo calle.

Passo passo andavam sanza sermone,
guardando e ascoltando li ammalati,
che non potean levar le lor persone.

Io vidi due sedere a sÃ© poggiati,
comâ a scaldar si poggia tegghia a tegghia,
dal capo al piÃ¨ di schianze macolati;

e non vidi giÃ  mai menare stregghia
a ragazzo aspettato dal segnorso,
nÃ© a colui che mal volontier vegghia,

come ciascun menava spesso il morso
de lâunghie sopra sÃ© per la gran rabbia
del pizzicor, che non ha piÃ¹ soccorso;

e sÃ¬ traevan giÃ¹ lâunghie la scabbia,
come coltel di scardova le scaglie
o dâaltro pesce che piÃ¹ larghe lâabbia.

Â«O tu che con le dita ti dismaglieÂ»,
cominciÃ² âl duca mio a lâun di loro,
Â«e che fai dâesse talvolta tanaglie,

dinne sâalcun Latino Ã¨ tra costoro
che son quincâ entro, se lâunghia ti basti
etternalmente a cotesto lavoroÂ».

Â«Latin siam noi, che tu vedi sÃ¬ guasti
qui ambedueÂ», rispuose lâun piangendo;
Â«ma tu chi seâ che di noi dimandasti?Â».

E âl duca disse: Â«Iâ son un che discendo
con questo vivo giÃ¹ di balzo in balzo,
e di mostrar lo ânferno a lui intendoÂ».

Allor si ruppe lo comun rincalzo;
e tremando ciascuno a me si volse
con altri che lâudiron di rimbalzo.

Lo buon maestro a me tutto sâaccolse,
dicendo: Â«DÃ¬ a lor ciÃ² che tu vuoliÂ»;
e io incominciai, poscia châei volse:

Â«Se la vostra memoria non sâimboli
nel primo mondo da lâumane menti,
ma sâella viva sotto molti soli,

ditemi chi voi siete e di che genti;
la vostra sconcia e fastidiosa pena
di palesarvi a me non vi spaventiÂ».

Â«Io fui dâArezzo, e Albero da SienaÂ»,
rispuose lâun, Â«mi fÃ© mettere al foco;
ma quel per châio moriâ qui non mi mena.

Vero Ã¨ châiâ dissi lui, parlando a gioco:
âIâ mi saprei levar per lâaere a voloâ;
e quei, châavea vaghezza e senno poco,

volle châiâ li mostrassi lâarte; e solo
perchâ io nol feci Dedalo, mi fece
ardere a tal che lâavea per figliuolo.

Ma ne lâultima bolgia de le diece
me per lâalchÃ¬mia che nel mondo usai
dannÃ² MinÃ²s, a cui fallar non leceÂ».

E io dissi al poeta: Â«Or fu giÃ  mai
gente sÃ¬ vana come la sanese?
Certo non la francesca sÃ¬ dâassai!Â».

Onde lâaltro lebbroso, che mâintese,
rispuose al detto mio: Â«Traâmene Stricca
che seppe far le temperate spese,

e NiccolÃ² che la costuma ricca
del garofano prima discoverse
ne lâorto dove tal seme sâappicca;

e traâne la brigata in che disperse
Caccia dâAscian la vigna e la gran fonda,
e lâAbbagliato suo senno proferse.

Ma perchÃ© sappi chi sÃ¬ ti seconda
contra i Sanesi, aguzza verâ me lâocchio,
sÃ¬ che la faccia mia ben ti risponda:

sÃ¬ vedrai châio son lâombra di Capocchio,
che falsai li metalli con lâalchÃ¬mia;
e te dee ricordar, se ben tâadocchio,

comâ io fui di natura buona scimiaÂ».



Inferno Â· Canto XXX


Nel tempo che Iunone era crucciata
per SemelÃ¨ contra âl sangue tebano,
come mostrÃ² una e altra fÃ¯ata,

Atamante divenne tanto insano,
che veggendo la moglie con due figli
andar carcata da ciascuna mano,

gridÃ²: Â«Tendiam le reti, sÃ¬ châio pigli
la leonessa e â leoncini al varcoÂ»;
e poi distese i dispietati artigli,

prendendo lâun châavea nome Learco,
e rotollo e percosselo ad un sasso;
e quella sâannegÃ² con lâaltro carco.

E quando la fortuna volse in basso
lâaltezza deâ Troian che tutto ardiva,
sÃ¬ che ânsieme col regno il re fu casso,

Ecuba trista, misera e cattiva,
poscia che vide Polissena morta,
e del suo Polidoro in su la riva

del mar si fu la dolorosa accorta,
forsennata latrÃ² sÃ¬ come cane;
tanto il dolor le fÃ© la mente torta.

Ma nÃ© di Tebe furie nÃ© troiane
si vider mÃ¤i in alcun tanto crude,
non punger bestie, nonchÃ© membra umane,

quantâ io vidi in due ombre smorte e nude,
che mordendo correvan di quel modo
che âl porco quando del porcil si schiude.

Lâuna giunse a Capocchio, e in sul nodo
del collo lâassannÃ², sÃ¬ che, tirando,
grattar li fece il ventre al fondo sodo.

E lâAretin che rimase, tremando
mi disse: Â«Quel folletto Ã¨ Gianni Schicchi,
e va rabbioso altrui cosÃ¬ conciandoÂ».

Â«OhÂ», dissâ io lui, Â«se lâaltro non ti ficchi
li denti a dosso, non ti sia fatica
a dir chi Ã¨, pria che di qui si spicchiÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«Quellâ Ã¨ lâanima antica
di Mirra scellerata, che divenne
al padre, fuor del dritto amore, amica.

Questa a peccar con esso cosÃ¬ venne,
falsificando sÃ© in altrui forma,
come lâaltro che lÃ  sen va, sostenne,

per guadagnar la donna de la torma,
falsificare in sÃ© Buoso Donati,
testando e dando al testamento normaÂ».

E poi che i due rabbiosi fuor passati
sovra cuâ io avea lâocchio tenuto,
rivolsilo a guardar li altri mal nati.

Io vidi un, fatto a guisa di lÃ«uto,
pur châelli avesse avuta lâanguinaia
tronca da lâaltro che lâuomo ha forcuto.

La grave idropesÃ¬, che sÃ¬ dispaia
le membra con lâomor che mal converte,
che âl viso non risponde a la ventraia,

faceva lui tener le labbra aperte
come lâetico fa, che per la sete
lâun verso âl mento e lâaltro in sÃ¹ rinverte.

Â«O voi che sanzâ alcuna pena siete,
e non so io perchÃ©, nel mondo gramoÂ»,
dissâ elli a noi, Â«guardate e attendete

a la miseria del maestro Adamo;
io ebbi, vivo, assai di quel châiâ volli,
e ora, lasso!, un gocciol dâacqua bramo.

Li ruscelletti che dâi verdi colli
del Casentin discendon giuso in Arno,
faccendo i lor canali freddi e molli,

sempre mi stanno innanzi, e non indarno,
chÃ© lâimagine lor vie piÃ¹ mâasciuga
che âl male ondâ io nel volto mi discarno.

La rigida giustizia che mi fruga
tragge cagion del loco ovâ io peccai
a metter piÃ¹ li miei sospiri in fuga.

Ivi Ã¨ Romena, lÃ  dovâ io falsai
la lega suggellata del Batista;
per châio il corpo sÃ¹ arso lasciai.

Ma sâio vedessi qui lâanima trista
di Guido o dâAlessandro o di lor frate,
per Fonte Branda non darei la vista.

Dentro câÃ¨ lâuna giÃ , se lâarrabbiate
ombre che vanno intorno dicon vero;
ma che mi val, câho le membra legate?

Sâio fossi pur di tanto ancor leggero
châiâ potessi in centâ anni andare unâoncia,
io sarei messo giÃ  per lo sentiero,

cercando lui tra questa gente sconcia,
con tutto châella volge undici miglia,
e men dâun mezzo di traverso non ci ha.

Io son per lor tra sÃ¬ fatta famiglia;
eâ mâindussero a batter li fiorini
châavevan tre carati di mondigliaÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Chi son li due tapini
che fumman come man bagnate âl verno,
giacendo stretti aâ tuoi destri confini?Â».

Â«Qui li trovaiâe poi volta non diernoâÂ»,
rispuose, Â«quando piovvi in questo greppo,
e non credo che dieno in sempiterno.

Lâuna Ã¨ la falsa châaccusÃ² Gioseppo;
lâaltrâ Ã¨ âl falso Sinon greco di Troia:
per febbre aguta gittan tanto leppoÂ».

E lâun di lor, che si recÃ² a noia
forse dâesser nomato sÃ¬ oscuro,
col pugno li percosse lâepa croia.

Quella sonÃ² come fosse un tamburo;
e mastro Adamo li percosse il volto
col braccio suo, che non parve men duro,

dicendo a lui: Â«Ancor che mi sia tolto
lo muover per le membra che son gravi,
ho io il braccio a tal mestiere scioltoÂ».

Ondâ ei rispuose: Â«Quando tu andavi
al fuoco, non lâavei tu cosÃ¬ presto;
ma sÃ¬ e piÃ¹ lâavei quando coniaviÂ».

E lâidropico: Â«Tu diâ ver di questo:
ma tu non fosti sÃ¬ ver testimonio
lÃ  âve del ver fosti a Troia richestoÂ».

Â«Sâio dissi falso, e tu falsasti il conioÂ»,
disse Sinon; Â«e son qui per un fallo,
e tu per piÃ¹ châalcun altro demonio!Â».

Â«Ricorditi, spergiuro, del cavalloÂ»,
rispuose quel châavÃ«a infiata lâepa;
Â«e sieti reo che tutto il mondo sallo!Â».

Â«E te sia rea la sete onde ti crepaÂ»,
disse âl Greco, Â«la lingua, e lâacqua marcia
che âl ventre innanzi a li occhi sÃ¬ tâassiepa!Â».

Allora il monetier: Â«CosÃ¬ si squarcia
la bocca tua per tuo mal come suole;
chÃ©, sâiâ ho sete e omor mi rinfarcia,

tu hai lâarsura e âl capo che ti duole,
e per leccar lo specchio di Narcisso,
non vorresti a ânvitar molte paroleÂ».

Ad ascoltarli erâ io del tutto fisso,
quando âl maestro mi disse: Â«Or pur mira,
che per poco che teco non mi risso!Â».

Quandâ io âl sentiâ a me parlar con ira,
volsimi verso lui con tal vergogna,
châancor per la memoria mi si gira.

Qual Ã¨ colui che suo dannaggio sogna,
che sognando desidera sognare,
sÃ¬ che quel châÃ¨, come non fosse, agogna,

tal mi fecâ io, non possendo parlare,
che disÃ¯ava scusarmi, e scusava
me tuttavia, e nol mi credea fare.

Â«Maggior difetto men vergogna lavaÂ»,
disse âl maestro, Â«che âl tuo non Ã¨ stato;
perÃ² dâogne trestizia ti disgrava.

E fa ragion châio ti sia sempre allato,
se piÃ¹ avvien che fortuna tâaccoglia
dove sien genti in simigliante piato:

chÃ© voler ciÃ² udire Ã¨ bassa vogliaÂ».



Inferno Â· Canto XXXI


Una medesma lingua pria mi morse,
sÃ¬ che mi tinse lâuna e lâaltra guancia,
e poi la medicina mi riporse;

cosÃ¬ odâ io che solea far la lancia
dâAchille e del suo padre esser cagione
prima di trista e poi di buona mancia.

Noi demmo il dosso al misero vallone
su per la ripa che âl cinge dintorno,
attraversando sanza alcun sermone.

Quivâ era men che notte e men che giorno,
sÃ¬ che âl viso mâandava innanzi poco;
ma io sentiâ sonare un alto corno,

tanto châavrebbe ogne tuon fatto fioco,
che, contra sÃ© la sua via seguitando,
dirizzÃ² li occhi miei tutti ad un loco.

Dopo la dolorosa rotta, quando
Carlo Magno perdÃ© la santa gesta,
non sonÃ² sÃ¬ terribilmente Orlando.

Poco portÃ¤i in lÃ  volta la testa,
che me parve veder molte alte torri;
ondâ io: Â«Maestro, dÃ¬, che terra Ã¨ questa?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«PerÃ² che tu trascorri
per le tenebre troppo da la lungi,
avvien che poi nel maginare abborri.

Tu vedrai ben, se tu lÃ  ti congiungi,
quanto âl senso sâinganna di lontano;
perÃ² alquanto piÃ¹ te stesso pungiÂ».

Poi caramente mi prese per mano
e disse: Â«Pria che noi siam piÃ¹ avanti,
acciÃ² che âl fatto men ti paia strano,

sappi che non son torri, ma giganti,
e son nel pozzo intorno da la ripa
da lâumbilico in giuso tutti quantiÂ».

Come quando la nebbia si dissipa,
lo sguardo a poco a poco raffigura
ciÃ² che cela âl vapor che lâaere stipa,

cosÃ¬ forando lâaura grossa e scura,
piÃ¹ e piÃ¹ appressando verâ la sponda,
fuggiemi errore e cresciemi paura;

perÃ² che, come su la cerchia tonda
Montereggion di torri si corona,
cosÃ¬ la proda che âl pozzo circonda

torreggiavan di mezza la persona
li orribili giganti, cui minaccia
Giove del cielo ancora quando tuona.

E io scorgeva giÃ  dâalcun la faccia,
le spalle e âl petto e del ventre gran parte,
e per le coste giÃ¹ ambo le braccia.

Natura certo, quando lasciÃ² lâarte
di sÃ¬ fatti animali, assai fÃ© bene
per tÃ²rre tali essecutori a Marte.

E sâella dâelefanti e di balene
non si pente, chi guarda sottilmente,
piÃ¹ giusta e piÃ¹ discreta la ne tene;

chÃ© dove lâargomento de la mente
sâaggiugne al mal volere e a la possa,
nessun riparo vi puÃ² far la gente.

La faccia sua mi parea lunga e grossa
come la pina di San Pietro a Roma,
e a sua proporzione eran lâaltre ossa;

sÃ¬ che la ripa, châera perizoma
dal mezzo in giÃ¹, ne mostrava ben tanto
di sovra, che di giugnere a la chioma

tre Frison sâaverien dato mal vanto;
perÃ² châiâ ne vedea trenta gran palmi
dal loco in giÃ¹ dovâ omo affibbia âl manto.

Â«RaphÃ¨l maÃ¬ amÃ¨cche zabÃ¬ almiÂ»,
cominciÃ² a gridar la fiera bocca,
cui non si convenia piÃ¹ dolci salmi.

E âl duca mio verâ lui: Â«Anima sciocca,
tienti col corno, e con quel ti disfoga
quandâ ira o altra passÃ¯on ti tocca!

CÃ©rcati al collo, e troverai la soga
che âl tien legato, o anima confusa,
e vedi lui che âl gran petto ti dogaÂ».

Poi disse a me: Â«Elli stessi sâaccusa;
questi Ã¨ Nembrotto per lo cui mal coto
pur un linguaggio nel mondo non sâusa.

LasciÃ nlo stare e non parliamo a vÃ²to;
chÃ© cosÃ¬ Ã¨ a lui ciascun linguaggio
come âl suo ad altrui, châa nullo Ã¨ notoÂ».

Facemmo adunque piÃ¹ lungo vÃ¯aggio,
vÃ²lti a sinistra; e al trar dâun balestro
trovammo lâaltro assai piÃ¹ fero e maggio.

A cigner lui qual che fosse âl maestro,
non so io dir, ma el tenea soccinto
dinanzi lâaltro e dietro il braccio destro

dâuna catena che âl tenea avvinto
dal collo in giÃ¹, sÃ¬ che ân su lo scoperto
si ravvolgÃ«a infino al giro quinto.

Â«Questo superbo volle esser esperto
di sua potenza contra âl sommo GioveÂ»,
disse âl mio duca, Â«ondâ elli ha cotal merto.

FÃ¯alte ha nome, e fece le gran prove
quando i giganti fer paura aâ dÃ¨i;
le braccia châel menÃ², giÃ  mai non moveÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Sâesser puote, io vorrei
che de lo smisurato BrÃ¯areo
esperÃ¯enza avesser li occhi meiÂ».

Ondâ ei rispuose: Â«Tu vedrai Anteo
presso di qui che parla ed Ã¨ disciolto,
che ne porrÃ  nel fondo dâogne reo.

Quel che tu vuoâ veder, piÃ¹ lÃ  Ã¨ molto
ed Ã¨ legato e fatto come questo,
salvo che piÃ¹ feroce par nel voltoÂ».

Non fu tremoto giÃ  tanto rubesto,
che scotesse una torre cosÃ¬ forte,
come FÃ¯alte a scuotersi fu presto.

Allor temettâ io piÃ¹ che mai la morte,
e non vâera mestier piÃ¹ che la dotta,
sâio non avessi viste le ritorte.

Noi procedemmo piÃ¹ avante allotta,
e venimmo ad Anteo, che ben cinque alle,
sanza la testa, uscia fuor de la grotta.

Â«O tu che ne la fortunata valle
che fece ScipÃ¯on di gloria reda,
quandâ AnibÃ l coâ suoi diede le spalle,

recasti giÃ  mille leon per preda,
e che, se fossi stato a lâalta guerra
deâ tuoi fratelli, ancor par che si creda

châavrebber vinto i figli de la terra:
mettine giÃ¹, e non ten vegna schifo,
dove Cocito la freddura serra.

Non ci fare ire a Tizio nÃ© a Tifo:
questi puÃ² dar di quel che qui si brama;
perÃ² ti china e non torcer lo grifo.

Ancor ti puÃ² nel mondo render fama,
châel vive, e lunga vita ancor aspetta
se ânnanzi tempo grazia a sÃ© nol chiamaÂ».

CosÃ¬ disse âl maestro; e quelli in fretta
le man distese, e prese âl duca mio,
ondâ Ercule sentÃ¬ giÃ  grande stretta.

Virgilio, quando prender si sentio,
disse a me: Â«Fatti qua, sÃ¬ châio ti prendaÂ»;
poi fece sÃ¬ châun fascio era elli e io.

Qual pare a riguardar la Carisenda
sotto âl chinato, quando un nuvol vada
sovrâ essa sÃ¬, ched ella incontro penda:

tal parve AntÃ«o a me che stava a bada
di vederlo chinare, e fu tal ora
châiâ avrei voluto ir per altra strada.

Ma lievemente al fondo che divora
Lucifero con Giuda, ci sposÃ²;
nÃ©, sÃ¬ chinato, lÃ¬ fece dimora,

e come albero in nave si levÃ².



Inferno Â· Canto XXXII


SâÃ¯o avessi le rime aspre e chiocce,
come si converrebbe al tristo buco
sovra âl qual pontan tutte lâaltre rocce,

io premerei di mio concetto il suco
piÃ¹ pienamente; ma perchâ io non lâabbo,
non sanza tema a dicer mi conduco;

chÃ© non Ã¨ impresa da pigliare a gabbo
discriver fondo a tutto lâuniverso,
nÃ© da lingua che chiami mamma o babbo.

Ma quelle donne aiutino il mio verso
châaiutaro AnfÃ¯one a chiuder Tebe,
sÃ¬ che dal fatto il dir non sia diverso.

Oh sovra tutte mal creata plebe
che stai nel loco onde parlare Ã¨ duro,
mei foste state qui pecore o zebe!

Come noi fummo giÃ¹ nel pozzo scuro
sotto i piÃ¨ del gigante assai piÃ¹ bassi,
e io mirava ancora a lâalto muro,

dicere udiâmi: Â«Guarda come passi:
va sÃ¬, che tu non calchi con le piante
le teste deâ fratei miseri lassiÂ».

Per châio mi volsi, e vidimi davante
e sotto i piedi un lago che per gelo
avea di vetro e non dâacqua sembiante.

Non fece al corso suo sÃ¬ grosso velo
di verno la Danoia in Osterlicchi,
nÃ© TanaÃ¯ lÃ  sotto âl freddo cielo,

comâ era quivi; che se Tambernicchi
vi fosse sÃ¹ caduto, o Pietrapana,
non avria pur da lâorlo fatto cricchi.

E come a gracidar si sta la rana
col muso fuor de lâacqua, quando sogna
di spigolar sovente la villana,

livide, insin lÃ  dove appar vergogna
eran lâombre dolenti ne la ghiaccia,
mettendo i denti in nota di cicogna.

Ognuna in giÃ¹ tenea volta la faccia;
da bocca il freddo, e da li occhi il cor tristo
tra lor testimonianza si procaccia.

Quandâ io mâebbi dintorno alquanto visto,
volsimi aâ piedi, e vidi due sÃ¬ stretti,
che âl pel del capo avieno insieme misto.

Â«Ditemi, voi che sÃ¬ strignete i pettiÂ»,
dissâ io, Â«chi siete?Â». E quei piegaro i colli;
e poi châebber li visi a me eretti,

li occhi lor, châeran pria pur dentro molli,
gocciar su per le labbra, e âl gelo strinse
le lagrime tra essi e riserrolli.

Con legno legno spranga mai non cinse
forte cosÃ¬; ondâ ei come due becchi
cozzaro insieme, tanta ira li vinse.

E un châavea perduti ambo li orecchi
per la freddura, pur col viso in giÃ¹e,
disse: Â«PerchÃ© cotanto in noi ti specchi?

Se vuoi saper chi son cotesti due,
la valle onde Bisenzo si dichina
del padre loro Alberto e di lor fue.

Dâun corpo usciro; e tutta la Caina
potrai cercare, e non troverai ombra
degna piÃ¹ dâesser fitta in gelatina:

non quelli a cui fu rotto il petto e lâombra
con esso un colpo per la man dâArtÃ¹;
non Focaccia; non questi che mâingombra

col capo sÃ¬, châiâ non veggio oltre piÃ¹,
e fu nomato Sassol Mascheroni;
se tosco seâ, ben sai omai chi fu.

E perchÃ© non mi metti in piÃ¹ sermoni,
sappi châiâ fuâ il Camiscion deâ Pazzi;
e aspetto Carlin che mi scagioniÂ».

Poscia vidâ io mille visi cagnazzi
fatti per freddo; onde mi vien riprezzo,
e verrÃ  sempre, deâ gelati guazzi.

E mentre châandavamo inverâ lo mezzo
al quale ogne gravezza si rauna,
e io tremava ne lâetterno rezzo;

se voler fu o destino o fortuna,
non so; ma, passeggiando tra le teste,
forte percossi âl piÃ¨ nel viso ad una.

Piangendo mi sgridÃ²: Â«PerchÃ© mi peste?
se tu non vieni a crescer la vendetta
di Montaperti, perchÃ© mi moleste?Â».

E io: Â«Maestro mio, or qui mâaspetta,
sÃ¬ châio esca dâun dubbio per costui;
poi mi farai, quantunque vorrai, frettaÂ».

Lo duca stette, e io dissi a colui
che bestemmiava duramente ancora:
Â«Qual seâ tu che cosÃ¬ rampogni altrui?Â».

Â«Or tu chi seâ che vai per lâAntenora,
percotendoÂ», rispuose, Â«altrui le gote,
sÃ¬ che, se fossi vivo, troppo fora?Â».

Â«Vivo son io, e caro esser ti puoteÂ»,
fu mia risposta, Â«se dimandi fama,
châio metta il nome tuo tra lâaltre noteÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«Del contrario ho io brama.
LÃ¨vati quinci e non mi dar piÃ¹ lagna,
chÃ© mal sai lusingar per questa lama!Â».

Allor lo presi per la cuticagna
e dissi: Â«El converrÃ  che tu ti nomi,
o che capel qui sÃ¹ non ti rimagnaÂ».

Ondâ elli a me: Â«PerchÃ© tu mi dischiomi,
nÃ© ti dirÃ² châio sia, nÃ© mosterrolti,
se mille fiate in sul capo mi tomiÂ».

Io avea giÃ  i capelli in mano avvolti,
e tratti glienâ avea piÃ¹ dâuna ciocca,
latrando lui con li occhi in giÃ¹ raccolti,

quando un altro gridÃ²: Â«Che hai tu, Bocca?
non ti basta sonar con le mascelle,
se tu non latri? qual diavol ti tocca?Â».

Â«OmaiÂ», dissâ io, Â«non voâ che piÃ¹ favelle,
malvagio traditor; châa la tua onta
io porterÃ² di te vere novelleÂ».

Â«Va viaÂ», rispuose, Â«e ciÃ² che tu vuoi conta;
ma non tacer, se tu di qua entro eschi,
di quel châebbe or cosÃ¬ la lingua pronta.

El piange qui lâargento deâ Franceschi:
âIo vidiâ, potrai dir, âquel da Duera
lÃ  dove i peccatori stanno freschiâ.

Se fossi domandato âAltri chi vâera?â,
tu hai dallato quel di Beccheria
di cui segÃ² Fiorenza la gorgiera.

Gianni deâ Soldanier credo che sia
piÃ¹ lÃ  con Ganellone e Tebaldello,
châaprÃ¬ Faenza quando si dormiaÂ».

Noi eravam partiti giÃ  da ello,
châio vidi due ghiacciati in una buca,
sÃ¬ che lâun capo a lâaltro era cappello;

e come âl pan per fame si manduca,
cosÃ¬ âl sovran li denti a lâaltro pose
lÃ  âve âl cervel sâaggiugne con la nuca:

non altrimenti TidÃ«o si rose
le tempie a Menalippo per disdegno,
che quei faceva il teschio e lâaltre cose.

Â«O tu che mostri per sÃ¬ bestial segno
odio sovra colui che tu ti mangi,
dimmi âl perchÃ©Â», dissâ io, Â«per tal convegno,

che se tu a ragion di lui ti piangi,
sappiendo chi voi siete e la sua pecca,
nel mondo suso ancora io te ne cangi,

se quella con châio parlo non si seccaÂ».



Inferno Â· Canto XXXIII


La bocca sollevÃ² dal fiero pasto
quel peccator, forbendola aâ capelli
del capo châelli avea di retro guasto.

Poi cominciÃ²: Â«Tu vuoâ châio rinovelli
disperato dolor che âl cor mi preme
giÃ  pur pensando, pria châio ne favelli.

Ma se le mie parole esser dien seme
che frutti infamia al traditor châiâ rodo,
parlar e lagrimar vedrai insieme.

Io non so chi tu seâ nÃ© per che modo
venuto seâ qua giÃ¹; ma fiorentino
mi sembri veramente quandâ io tâodo.

Tu dei saper châiâ fui conte Ugolino,
e questi Ã¨ lâarcivescovo Ruggieri:
or ti dirÃ² perchÃ© i son tal vicino.

Che per lâeffetto deâ suoâ mai pensieri,
fidandomi di lui, io fossi preso
e poscia morto, dir non Ã¨ mestieri;

perÃ² quel che non puoi avere inteso,
cioÃ¨ come la morte mia fu cruda,
udirai, e saprai sâeâ mâha offeso.

Breve pertugio dentro da la Muda,
la qual per me ha âl titol de la fame,
e che conviene ancor châaltrui si chiuda,

mâavea mostrato per lo suo forame
piÃ¹ lune giÃ , quandâ io feci âl mal sonno
che del futuro mi squarciÃ² âl velame.

Questi pareva a me maestro e donno,
cacciando il lupo e â lupicini al monte
per che i Pisan veder Lucca non ponno.

Con cagne magre, studÃ¯ose e conte
Gualandi con Sismondi e con Lanfranchi
sâavea messi dinanzi da la fronte.

In picciol corso mi parieno stanchi
lo padre e â figli, e con lâagute scane
mi parea lor veder fender li fianchi.

Quando fui desto innanzi la dimane,
pianger sentiâ fra âl sonno i miei figliuoli
châeran con meco, e dimandar del pane.

Ben seâ crudel, se tu giÃ  non ti duoli
pensando ciÃ² che âl mio cor sâannunziava;
e se non piangi, di che pianger suoli?

GiÃ  eran desti, e lâora sâappressava
che âl cibo ne solÃ«a essere addotto,
e per suo sogno ciascun dubitava;

e io sentiâ chiavar lâuscio di sotto
a lâorribile torre; ondâ io guardai
nel viso aâ mieâ figliuoi sanza far motto.

Io non piangÃ«a, sÃ¬ dentro impetrai:
piangevan elli; e Anselmuccio mio
disse: âTu guardi sÃ¬, padre! che hai?â.

PerciÃ² non lagrimai nÃ© rispuosâ io
tutto quel giorno nÃ© la notte appresso,
infin che lâaltro sol nel mondo uscÃ¬o.

Come un poco di raggio si fu messo
nel doloroso carcere, e io scorsi
per quattro visi il mio aspetto stesso,

ambo le man per lo dolor mi morsi;
ed ei, pensando châio âl fessi per voglia
di manicar, di sÃ¹bito levorsi

e disser: âPadre, assai ci fia men doglia
se tu mangi di noi: tu ne vestisti
queste misere carni, e tu le spogliaâ.

Quetaâmi allor per non farli piÃ¹ tristi;
lo dÃ¬ e lâaltro stemmo tutti muti;
ahi dura terra, perchÃ© non tâapristi?

Poscia che fummo al quarto dÃ¬ venuti,
Gaddo mi si gittÃ² disteso aâ piedi,
dicendo: âPadre mio, chÃ© non mâaiuti?â.

Quivi morÃ¬; e come tu mi vedi,
vidâ io cascar li tre ad uno ad uno
tra âl quinto dÃ¬ e âl sesto; ondâ io mi diedi,

giÃ  cieco, a brancolar sovra ciascuno,
e due dÃ¬ li chiamai, poi che fur morti.
Poscia, piÃ¹ che âl dolor, potÃ© âl digiunoÂ».

Quandâ ebbe detto ciÃ², con li occhi torti
riprese âl teschio misero coâ denti,
che furo a lâosso, come dâun can, forti.

Ahi Pisa, vituperio de le genti
del bel paese lÃ  dove âl sÃ¬ suona,
poi che i vicini a te punir son lenti,

muovasi la Capraia e la Gorgona,
e faccian siepe ad Arno in su la foce,
sÃ¬ châelli annieghi in te ogne persona!

Che se âl conte Ugolino aveva voce
dâaver tradita te de le castella,
non dovei tu i figliuoi porre a tal croce.

Innocenti facea lâetÃ  novella,
novella Tebe, Uguiccione e âl Brigata
e li altri due che âl canto suso appella.

Noi passammo oltre, lÃ  âve la gelata
ruvidamente unâaltra gente fascia,
non volta in giÃ¹, ma tutta riversata.

Lo pianto stesso lÃ¬ pianger non lascia,
e âl duol che truova in su li occhi rintoppo,
si volge in entro a far crescer lâambascia;

chÃ© le lagrime prime fanno groppo,
e sÃ¬ come visiere di cristallo,
rÃ¯empion sotto âl ciglio tutto il coppo.

E avvegna che, sÃ¬ come dâun callo,
per la freddura ciascun sentimento
cessato avesse del mio viso stallo,

giÃ  mi parea sentire alquanto vento;
per châio: Â«Maestro mio, questo chi move?
non Ã¨ qua giÃ¹ ogne vapore spento?Â».

Ondâ elli a me: Â«Avaccio sarai dove
di ciÃ² ti farÃ  lâocchio la risposta,
veggendo la cagion che âl fiato pioveÂ».

E un deâ tristi de la fredda crosta
gridÃ² a noi: Â«O anime crudeli
tanto che data vâÃ¨ lâultima posta,

levatemi dal viso i duri veli,
sÃ¬ châÃ¯o sfoghi âl duol che âl cor mâimpregna,
un poco, pria che âl pianto si raggeliÂ».

Per châio a lui: Â«Se vuoâ châiâ ti sovvegna,
dimmi chi seâ, e sâio non ti disbrigo,
al fondo de la ghiaccia ir mi convegnaÂ».

Rispuose adunque: Â«Iâ son frate Alberigo;
iâ son quel da le frutta del mal orto,
che qui riprendo dattero per figoÂ».

Â«OhÂ», dissâ io lui, Â«or seâ tu ancor morto?Â».
Ed elli a me: Â«Come âl mio corpo stea
nel mondo sÃ¹, nulla scÃ¯enza porto.

Cotal vantaggio ha questa Tolomea,
che spesse volte lâanima ci cade
innanzi châAtropÃ²s mossa le dea.

E perchÃ© tu piÃ¹ volentier mi rade
le ânvetrÃ¯ate lagrime dal volto,
sappie che, tosto che lâanima trade

come fecâ Ã¯o, il corpo suo lâÃ¨ tolto
da un demonio, che poscia il governa
mentre che âl tempo suo tutto sia vÃ²lto.

Ella ruina in sÃ¬ fatta cisterna;
e forse pare ancor lo corpo suso
de lâombra che di qua dietro mi verna.

Tu âl dei saper, se tu vien pur mo giuso:
elli Ã¨ ser Branca Doria, e son piÃ¹ anni
poscia passati châel fu sÃ¬ racchiusoÂ».

Â«Io credoÂ», dissâ io lui, Â«che tu mâinganni;
chÃ© Branca Doria non morÃ¬ unquanche,
e mangia e bee e dorme e veste panniÂ».

Â«Nel fosso sÃ¹Â», dissâ el, Â«deâ Malebranche,
lÃ  dove bolle la tenace pece,
non era ancora giunto Michel Zanche,

che questi lasciÃ² il diavolo in sua vece
nel corpo suo, ed un suo prossimano
che âl tradimento insieme con lui fece.

Ma distendi oggimai in qua la mano;
aprimi li occhiÂ». E io non glielâ apersi;
e cortesia fu lui esser villano.

Ahi Genovesi, uomini diversi
dâogne costume e pien dâogne magagna,
perchÃ© non siete voi del mondo spersi?

ChÃ© col peggiore spirto di Romagna
trovai di voi un tal, che per sua opra
in anima in Cocito giÃ  si bagna,

e in corpo par vivo ancor di sopra.



Inferno Â· Canto XXXIV


Â«Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni
verso di noi; perÃ² dinanzi miraÂ»,
disse âl maestro mio, Â«se tu âl discerniÂ».

Come quando una grossa nebbia spira,
o quando lâemisperio nostro annotta,
par di lungi un molin che âl vento gira,

veder mi parve un tal dificio allotta;
poi per lo vento mi ristrinsi retro
al duca mio, chÃ© non lÃ¬ era altra grotta.

GiÃ  era, e con paura il metto in metro,
lÃ  dove lâombre tutte eran coperte,
e trasparien come festuca in vetro.

Altre sono a giacere; altre stanno erte,
quella col capo e quella con le piante;
altra, comâ arco, il volto aâ piÃ¨ rinverte.

Quando noi fummo fatti tanto avante,
châal mio maestro piacque di mostrarmi
la creatura châebbe il bel sembiante,

dâinnanzi mi si tolse e fÃ© restarmi,
Â«Ecco DiteÂ», dicendo, Â«ed ecco il loco
ove convien che di fortezza tâarmiÂ».

Comâ io divenni allor gelato e fioco,
nol dimandar, lettor, châiâ non lo scrivo,
perÃ² châogne parlar sarebbe poco.

Io non moriâ e non rimasi vivo;
pensa oggimai per te, sâhai fior dâingegno,
qual io divenni, dâuno e dâaltro privo.

Lo âmperador del doloroso regno
da mezzo âl petto uscia fuor de la ghiaccia;
e piÃ¹ con un gigante io mi convegno,

che i giganti non fan con le sue braccia:
vedi oggimai quantâ esser dee quel tutto
châa cosÃ¬ fatta parte si confaccia.

Sâel fu sÃ¬ bel comâ elli Ã¨ ora brutto,
e contra âl suo fattore alzÃ² le ciglia,
ben dee da lui procedere ogne lutto.

Oh quanto parve a me gran maraviglia
quandâ io vidi tre facce a la sua testa!
Lâuna dinanzi, e quella era vermiglia;

lâaltrâ eran due, che sâaggiugnieno a questa
sovresso âl mezzo di ciascuna spalla,
e sÃ© giugnieno al loco de la cresta:

e la destra parea tra bianca e gialla;
la sinistra a vedere era tal, quali
vegnon di lÃ  onde âl Nilo sâavvalla.

Sotto ciascuna uscivan due grandâ ali,
quanto si convenia a tanto uccello:
vele di mar non vidâ io mai cotali.

Non avean penne, ma di vispistrello
era lor modo; e quelle svolazzava,
sÃ¬ che tre venti si movean da ello:

quindi Cocito tutto sâaggelava.
Con sei occhi piangÃ«a, e per tre menti
gocciava âl pianto e sanguinosa bava.

Da ogne bocca dirompea coâ denti
un peccatore, a guisa di maciulla,
sÃ¬ che tre ne facea cosÃ¬ dolenti.

A quel dinanzi il mordere era nulla
verso âl graffiar, che talvolta la schiena
rimanea de la pelle tutta brulla.

Â«Quellâ anima lÃ  sÃ¹ câha maggior penaÂ»,
disse âl maestro, Â«Ã¨ Giuda ScarÃ¯otto,
che âl capo ha dentro e fuor le gambe mena.

De li altri due câhanno il capo di sotto,
quel che pende dal nero ceffo Ã¨ Bruto:
vedi come si storce, e non fa motto!;

e lâaltro Ã¨ Cassio, che par sÃ¬ membruto.
Ma la notte risurge, e oramai
Ã¨ da partir, chÃ© tutto avem vedutoÂ».

Comâ a lui piacque, il collo li avvinghiai;
ed el prese di tempo e loco poste,
e quando lâali fuoro aperte assai,

appigliÃ² sÃ© a le vellute coste;
di vello in vello giÃ¹ discese poscia
tra âl folto pelo e le gelate croste.

Quando noi fummo lÃ  dove la coscia
si volge, a punto in sul grosso de lâanche,
lo duca, con fatica e con angoscia,

volse la testa ovâ elli avea le zanche,
e aggrappossi al pel comâ om che sale,
sÃ¬ che ân inferno iâ credea tornar anche.

Â«Attienti ben, chÃ© per cotali scaleÂ»,
disse âl maestro, ansando comâ uom lasso,
Â«conviensi dipartir da tanto maleÂ».

Poi uscÃ¬ fuor per lo fÃ³ro dâun sasso
e puose me in su lâorlo a sedere;
appresso porse a me lâaccorto passo.

Io levai li occhi e credetti vedere
Lucifero comâ io lâavea lasciato,
e vidili le gambe in sÃ¹ tenere;

e sâio divenni allora travagliato,
la gente grossa il pensi, che non vede
qual Ã¨ quel punto châio avea passato.

Â«LÃ¨vati sÃ¹Â», disse âl maestro, Â«in piede:
la via Ã¨ lunga e âl cammino Ã¨ malvagio,
e giÃ  il sole a mezza terza riedeÂ».

Non era camminata di palagio
lÃ  âvâ eravam, ma natural burella
châavea mal suolo e di lume disagio.

Â«Prima châio de lâabisso mi divella,
maestro mioÂ», dissâ io quando fui dritto,
Â«a trarmi dâerro un poco mi favella:

ovâ Ã¨ la ghiaccia? e questi comâ Ã¨ fitto
sÃ¬ sottosopra? e come, in sÃ¬ pocâ ora,
da sera a mane ha fatto il sol tragitto?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«Tu imagini ancora
dâesser di lÃ  dal centro, ovâ io mi presi
al pel del vermo reo che âl mondo fÃ³ra.

Di lÃ  fosti cotanto quantâ io scesi;
quandâ io mi volsi, tu passasti âl punto
al qual si traggon dâogne parte i pesi.

E seâ or sotto lâemisperio giunto
châÃ¨ contraposto a quel che la gran secca
coverchia, e sotto âl cui colmo consunto

fu lâuom che nacque e visse sanza pecca;
tu haÃ¯ i piedi in su picciola spera
che lâaltra faccia fa de la Giudecca.

Qui Ã¨ da man, quando di lÃ  Ã¨ sera;
e questi, che ne fÃ© scala col pelo,
fitto Ã¨ ancora sÃ¬ come primâ era.

Da questa parte cadde giÃ¹ dal cielo;
e la terra, che pria di qua si sporse,
per paura di lui fÃ© del mar velo,

e venne a lâemisperio nostro; e forse
per fuggir lui lasciÃ² qui loco vÃ²to
quella châappar di qua, e sÃ¹ ricorseÂ».

Luogo Ã¨ lÃ  giÃ¹ da BelzebÃ¹ remoto
tanto quanto la tomba si distende,
che non per vista, ma per suono Ã¨ noto

dâun ruscelletto che quivi discende
per la buca dâun sasso, châelli ha roso,
col corso châelli avvolge, e poco pende.

Lo duca e io per quel cammino ascoso
intrammo a ritornar nel chiaro mondo;
e sanza cura aver dâalcun riposo,

salimmo sÃ¹, el primo e io secondo,
tanto châiâ vidi de le cose belle
che porta âl ciel, per un pertugio tondo.

E quindi uscimmo a riveder le stelle.





PURGATORIO




Purgatorio Â· Canto I


Per correr miglior acque alza le vele
omai la navicella del mio ingegno,
che lascia dietro a sÃ© mar sÃ¬ crudele;

e canterÃ² di quel secondo regno
dove lâumano spirito si purga
e di salire al ciel diventa degno.

Ma qui la morta poesÃ¬ resurga,
o sante Muse, poi che vostro sono;
e qui CalÃ¯opÃ¨ alquanto surga,

seguitando il mio canto con quel suono
di cui le Piche misere sentiro
lo colpo tal, che disperar perdono.

Dolce color dâorÃ¯ental zaffiro,
che sâaccoglieva nel sereno aspetto
del mezzo, puro infino al primo giro,

a li occhi miei ricominciÃ² diletto,
tosto châio usciâ fuor de lâaura morta
che mâavea contristati li occhi e âl petto.

Lo bel pianeto che dâamar conforta
faceva tutto rider lâorÃ¯ente,
velando i Pesci châerano in sua scorta.

Iâ mi volsi a man destra, e puosi mente
a lâaltro polo, e vidi quattro stelle
non viste mai fuor châa la prima gente.

Goder pareva âl ciel di lor fiammelle:
oh settentrÃ¯onal vedovo sito,
poi che privato seâ di mirar quelle!

Comâ io da loro sguardo fui partito,
un poco me volgendo a l âaltro polo,
lÃ  onde âl Carro giÃ  era sparito,

vidi presso di me un veglio solo,
degno di tanta reverenza in vista,
che piÃ¹ non dee a padre alcun figliuolo.

Lunga la barba e di pel bianco mista
portava, aâ suoi capelli simigliante,
deâ quai cadeva al petto doppia lista.

Li raggi de le quattro luci sante
fregiavan sÃ¬ la sua faccia di lume,
châiâ âl vedea come âl sol fosse davante.

Â«Chi siete voi che contro al cieco fiume
fuggita avete la pregione etterna?Â»,
dissâ el, movendo quelle oneste piume.

Â«Chi vâha guidati, o che vi fu lucerna,
uscendo fuor de la profonda notte
che sempre nera fa la valle inferna?

Son le leggi dâabisso cosÃ¬ rotte?
o Ã¨ mutato in ciel novo consiglio,
che, dannati, venite a le mie grotte?Â».

Lo duca mio allor mi diÃ¨ di piglio,
e con parole e con mani e con cenni
reverenti mi fÃ© le gambe e âl ciglio.

Poscia rispuose lui: Â«Da me non venni:
donna scese del ciel, per li cui prieghi
de la mia compagnia costui sovvenni.

Ma da châÃ¨ tuo voler che piÃ¹ si spieghi
di nostra condizion comâ ellâ Ã¨ vera,
esser non puote il mio che a te si nieghi.

Questi non vide mai lâultima sera;
ma per la sua follia le fu sÃ¬ presso,
che molto poco tempo a volger era.

SÃ¬ comâ io dissi, fui mandato ad esso
per lui campare; e non lÃ¬ era altra via
che questa per la quale iâ mi son messo.

Mostrata ho lui tutta la gente ria;
e ora intendo mostrar quelli spirti
che purgan sÃ© sotto la tua balÃ¬a.

Comâ io lâho tratto, saria lungo a dirti;
de lâalto scende virtÃ¹ che mâaiuta
conducerlo a vederti e a udirti.

Or ti piaccia gradir la sua venuta:
libertÃ  va cercando, châÃ¨ sÃ¬ cara,
come sa chi per lei vita rifiuta.

Tu âl sai, chÃ© non ti fu per lei amara
in Utica la morte, ove lasciasti
la vesta châal gran dÃ¬ sarÃ  sÃ¬ chiara.

Non son li editti etterni per noi guasti,
chÃ© questi vive e MinÃ²s me non lega;
ma son del cerchio ove son li occhi casti

di Marzia tua, che ân vista ancor ti priega,
o santo petto, che per tua la tegni:
per lo suo amore adunque a noi ti piega.

Lasciane andar per li tuoi sette regni;
grazie riporterÃ² di te a lei,
se dâesser mentovato lÃ  giÃ¹ degniÂ».

Â«MarzÃ¯a piacque tanto a li occhi miei
mentre châiâ fuâ di lÃ Â», dissâ elli allora,
Â«che quante grazie volse da me, fei.

Or che di lÃ  dal mal fiume dimora,
piÃ¹ muover non mi puÃ², per quella legge
che fatta fu quando me nâusciâ fora.

Ma se donna del ciel ti move e regge,
come tu diâ, non câÃ¨ mestier lusinghe:
bastisi ben che per lei mi richegge.

Va dunque, e fa che tu costui ricinghe
dâun giunco schietto e che li lavi âl viso,
sÃ¬ châogne sucidume quindi stinghe;

chÃ© non si converria, lâocchio sorpriso
dâalcuna nebbia, andar dinanzi al primo
ministro, châÃ¨ di quei di paradiso.

Questa isoletta intorno ad imo ad imo,
lÃ  giÃ¹ colÃ  dove la batte lâonda,
porta di giunchi sovra âl molle limo:

nullâ altra pianta che facesse fronda
o indurasse, vi puote aver vita,
perÃ² châa le percosse non seconda.

Poscia non sia di qua vostra reddita;
lo sol vi mosterrÃ , che surge omai,
prendere il monte a piÃ¹ lieve salitaÂ».

CosÃ¬ sparÃ¬; e io sÃ¹ mi levai
sanza parlare, e tutto mi ritrassi
al duca mio, e li occhi a lui drizzai.

El cominciÃ²: Â«Figliuol, segui i miei passi:
volgianci in dietro, chÃ© di qua dichina
questa pianura aâ suoi termini bassiÂ».

Lâalba vinceva lâora mattutina
che fuggia innanzi, sÃ¬ che di lontano
conobbi il tremolar de la marina.

Noi andavam per lo solingo piano
comâ om che torna a la perduta strada,
che ânfino ad essa li pare ire in vano.

Quando noi fummo lÃ  âve la rugiada
pugna col sole, per essere in parte
dove, ad orezza, poco si dirada,

ambo le mani in su lâerbetta sparte
soavemente âl mio maestro pose:
ondâ io, che fui accorto di sua arte,

porsi verâ lui le guance lagrimose;
ivi mi fece tutto discoverto
quel color che lâinferno mi nascose.

Venimmo poi in sul lito diserto,
che mai non vide navicar sue acque
omo, che di tornar sia poscia esperto.

Quivi mi cinse sÃ¬ comâ altrui piacque:
oh maraviglia! chÃ© qual elli scelse
lâumile pianta, cotal si rinacque

subitamente lÃ  onde lâavelse.



Purgatorio Â· Canto II


GiÃ  era âl sole a lâorizzonte giunto
lo cui meridÃ¯an cerchio coverchia
IerusalÃ¨m col suo piÃ¹ alto punto;

e la notte, che opposita a lui cerchia,
uscia di Gange fuor con le Bilance,
che le caggion di man quando soverchia;

sÃ¬ che le bianche e le vermiglie guance,
lÃ  dovâ iâ era, de la bella Aurora
per troppa etate divenivan rance.

Noi eravam lunghesso mare ancora,
come gente che pensa a suo cammino,
che va col cuore e col corpo dimora.

Ed ecco, qual, sorpreso dal mattino,
per li grossi vapor Marte rosseggia
giÃ¹ nel ponente sovra âl suol marino,

cotal mâapparve, sâio ancor lo veggia,
un lume per lo mar venir sÃ¬ ratto,
che âl muover suo nessun volar pareggia.

Dal qual comâ io un poco ebbi ritratto
lâocchio per domandar lo duca mio,
rividil piÃ¹ lucente e maggior fatto.

Poi dâogne lato ad esso mâappario
un non sapeva che bianco, e di sotto
a poco a poco un altro a lui uscÃ¬o.

Lo mio maestro ancor non facea motto,
mentre che i primi bianchi apparver ali;
allor che ben conobbe il galeotto,

gridÃ²: Â«Fa, fa che le ginocchia cali.
Ecco lâangel di Dio: piega le mani;
omai vedrai di sÃ¬ fatti officiali.

Vedi che sdegna li argomenti umani,
sÃ¬ che remo non vuol, nÃ© altro velo
che lâali sue, tra liti sÃ¬ lontani.

Vedi come lâha dritte verso âl cielo,
trattando lâaere con lâetterne penne,
che non si mutan come mortal peloÂ».

Poi, come piÃ¹ e piÃ¹ verso noi venne
lâuccel divino, piÃ¹ chiaro appariva:
per che lâocchio da presso nol sostenne,

ma chinail giuso; e quei sen venne a riva
con un vasello snelletto e leggero,
tanto che lâacqua nulla ne ânghiottiva.

Da poppa stava il celestial nocchiero,
tal che faria beato pur descripto;
e piÃ¹ di cento spirti entro sediero.

âIn exitu IsrÃ¤el de Aegyptoâ
cantavan tutti insieme ad una voce
con quanto di quel salmo Ã¨ poscia scripto.

Poi fece il segno lor di santa croce;
ondâ ei si gittar tutti in su la piaggia:
ed el sen gÃ¬, come venne, veloce.

La turba che rimase lÃ¬, selvaggia
parea del loco, rimirando intorno
come colui che nove cose assaggia.

Da tutte parti saettava il giorno
lo sol, châavea con le saette conte
di mezzo âl ciel cacciato Capricorno,

quando la nova gente alzÃ² la fronte
verâ noi, dicendo a noi: Â«Se voi sapete,
mostratene la via di gire al monteÂ».

E Virgilio rispuose: Â«Voi credete
forse che siamo esperti dâesto loco;
ma noi siam peregrin come voi siete.

Dianzi venimmo, innanzi a voi un poco,
per altra via, che fu sÃ¬ aspra e forte,
che lo salire omai ne parrÃ  giocoÂ».

Lâanime, che si fuor di me accorte,
per lo spirare, châiâ era ancor vivo,
maravigliando diventaro smorte.

E come a messagger che porta ulivo
tragge la gente per udir novelle,
e di calcar nessun si mostra schivo,

cosÃ¬ al viso mio sâaffisar quelle
anime fortunate tutte quante,
quasi oblÃ¯ando dâire a farsi belle.

Io vidi una di lor trarresi avante
per abbracciarmi con sÃ¬ grande affetto,
che mosse me a far lo somigliante.

Ohi ombre vane, fuor che ne lâaspetto!
tre volte dietro a lei le mani avvinsi,
e tante mi tornai con esse al petto.

Di maraviglia, credo, mi dipinsi;
per che lâombra sorrise e si ritrasse,
e io, seguendo lei, oltre mi pinsi.

Soavemente disse châio posasse;
allor conobbi chi era, e pregai
che, per parlarmi, un poco sâarrestasse.

Rispuosemi: Â«CosÃ¬ comâ io tâamai
nel mortal corpo, cosÃ¬ tâamo sciolta:
perÃ² mâarresto; ma tu perchÃ© vai?Â».

Â«Casella mio, per tornar altra volta
lÃ  dovâ io son, fo io questo vÃ¯aggioÂ»,
dissâ io; Â«ma a te comâ Ã¨ tanta ora tolta?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«Nessun mâÃ¨ fatto oltraggio,
se quei che leva quando e cui li piace,
piÃ¹ volte mâha negato esto passaggio;

chÃ© di giusto voler lo suo si face:
veramente da tre mesi elli ha tolto
chi ha voluto intrar, con tutta pace.

Ondâ io, châera ora a la marina vÃ²lto
dove lâacqua di Tevero sâinsala,
benignamente fuâ da lui ricolto.

A quella foce ha elli or dritta lâala,
perÃ² che sempre quivi si ricoglie
qual verso Acheronte non si calaÂ».

E io: Â«Se nuova legge non ti toglie
memoria o uso a lâamoroso canto
che mi solea quetar tutte mie doglie,

di ciÃ² ti piaccia consolare alquanto
lâanima mia, che, con la sua persona
venendo qui, Ã¨ affannata tanto!Â».

âAmor che ne la mente mi ragionaâ
cominciÃ² elli allor sÃ¬ dolcemente,
che la dolcezza ancor dentro mi suona.

Lo mio maestro e io e quella gente
châeran con lui parevan sÃ¬ contenti,
come a nessun toccasse altro la mente.

Noi eravam tutti fissi e attenti
a le sue note; ed ecco il veglio onesto
gridando: Â«Che Ã¨ ciÃ², spiriti lenti?

qual negligenza, quale stare Ã¨ questo?
Correte al monte a spogliarvi lo scoglio
châesser non lascia a voi Dio manifestoÂ».

Come quando, cogliendo biado o loglio,
li colombi adunati a la pastura,
queti, sanza mostrar lâusato orgoglio,

se cosa appare ondâ elli abbian paura,
subitamente lasciano star lâesca,
perchâ assaliti son da maggior cura;

cosÃ¬ vidâ io quella masnada fresca
lasciar lo canto, e fuggir verâ la costa,
comâ om che va, nÃ© sa dove rÃ¯esca;

nÃ© la nostra partita fu men tosta.



Purgatorio Â· Canto III


Avvegna che la subitana fuga
dispergesse color per la campagna,
rivolti al monte ove ragion ne fruga,

iâ mi ristrinsi a la fida compagna:
e come sareâ io sanza lui corso?
chi mâavria tratto su per la montagna?

El mi parea da sÃ© stesso rimorso:
o dignitosa coscÃ¯enza e netta,
come tâÃ¨ picciol fallo amaro morso!

Quando li piedi suoi lasciar la fretta,
che lâonestade ad ognâ atto dismaga,
la mente mia, che prima era ristretta,

lo ântento rallargÃ², sÃ¬ come vaga,
e diedi âl viso mio incontrâ al poggio
che ânverso âl ciel piÃ¹ alto si dislaga.

Lo sol, che dietro fiammeggiava roggio,
rotto mâera dinanzi a la figura,
châavÃ«a in me deâ suoi raggi lâappoggio.

Io mi volsi dallato con paura
dâessere abbandonato, quandâ io vidi
solo dinanzi a me la terra oscura;

e âl mio conforto: Â«PerchÃ© pur diffidi?Â»,
a dir mi cominciÃ² tutto rivolto;
Â«non credi tu me teco e châio ti guidi?

Vespero Ã¨ giÃ  colÃ  dovâ Ã¨ sepolto
lo corpo dentro al quale io facea ombra;
Napoli lâha, e da Brandizio Ã¨ tolto.

Ora, se innanzi a me nulla sâaombra,
non ti maravigliar piÃ¹ che dâi cieli
che lâuno a lâaltro raggio non ingombra.

A sofferir tormenti, caldi e geli
simili corpi la VirtÃ¹ dispone
che, come fa, non vuol châa noi si sveli.

Matto Ã¨ chi spera che nostra ragione
possa trascorrer la infinita via
che tiene una sustanza in tre persone.

State contenti, umana gente, al quia;
chÃ©, se potuto aveste veder tutto,
mestier non era parturir Maria;

e disÃ¯ar vedeste sanza frutto
tai che sarebbe lor disio quetato,
châetternalmente Ã¨ dato lor per lutto:

io dico dâAristotile e di Plato
e di moltâ altriÂ»; e qui chinÃ² la fronte,
e piÃ¹ non disse, e rimase turbato.

Noi divenimmo intanto a piÃ¨ del monte;
quivi trovammo la roccia sÃ¬ erta,
che ândarno vi sarien le gambe pronte.

Tra Lerice e TurbÃ¬a la piÃ¹ diserta,
la piÃ¹ rotta ruina Ã¨ una scala,
verso di quella, agevole e aperta.

Â«Or chi sa da qual man la costa calaÂ»,
disse âl maestro mio fermando âl passo,
Â«sÃ¬ che possa salir chi va sanzâ ala?Â».

E mentre châeâ tenendo âl viso basso
essaminava del cammin la mente,
e io mirava suso intorno al sasso,

da man sinistra mâapparÃ¬ una gente
dâanime, che movieno i piÃ¨ verâ noi,
e non pareva, sÃ¬ venÃ¯an lente.

Â«LevaÂ», dissâ io, Â«maestro, li occhi tuoi:
ecco di qua chi ne darÃ  consiglio,
se tu da te medesmo aver nol puoiÂ».

GuardÃ² allora, e con libero piglio
rispuose: Â«Andiamo in lÃ , châei vegnon piano;
e tu ferma la spene, dolce figlioÂ».

Ancora era quel popol di lontano,
iâ dico dopo i nostri mille passi,
quanto un buon gittator trarria con mano,

quando si strinser tutti ai duri massi
de lâalta ripa, e stetter fermi e stretti
comâ a guardar, chi va dubbiando, stassi.

Â«O ben finiti, o giÃ  spiriti elettiÂ»,
Virgilio incominciÃ², Â«per quella pace
châiâ credo che per voi tutti sâaspetti,

ditene dove la montagna giace,
sÃ¬ che possibil sia lâandare in suso;
chÃ© perder tempo a chi piÃ¹ sa piÃ¹ spiaceÂ».

Come le pecorelle escon del chiuso
a una, a due, a tre, e lâaltre stanno
timidette atterrando lâocchio e âl muso;

e ciÃ² che fa la prima, e lâaltre fanno,
addossandosi a lei, sâella sâarresta,
semplici e quete, e lo âmperchÃ© non sanno;

sÃ¬ vidâ io muovere a venir la testa
di quella mandra fortunata allotta,
pudica in faccia e ne lâandare onesta.

Come color dinanzi vider rotta
la luce in terra dal mio destro canto,
sÃ¬ che lâombra era da me a la grotta,

restaro, e trasser sÃ© in dietro alquanto,
e tutti li altri che venieno appresso,
non sappiendo âl perchÃ©, fenno altrettanto.

Â«Sanza vostra domanda io vi confesso
che questo Ã¨ corpo uman che voi vedete;
per che âl lume del sole in terra Ã¨ fesso.

Non vi maravigliate, ma credete
che non sanza virtÃ¹ che da ciel vegna
cerchi di soverchiar questa pareteÂ».

CosÃ¬ âl maestro; e quella gente degna
Â«TornateÂ», disse, Â«intrate innanzi dunqueÂ»,
coi dossi de le man faccendo insegna.

E un di loro incominciÃ²: Â«Chiunque
tu seâ, cosÃ¬ andando, volgi âl viso:
pon mente se di lÃ  mi vedesti unqueÂ».

Io mi volsi verâ lui e guardail fiso:
biondo era e bello e di gentile aspetto,
ma lâun deâ cigli un colpo avea diviso.

Quandâ io mi fui umilmente disdetto
dâaverlo visto mai, el disse: Â«Or vediÂ»;
e mostrommi una piaga a sommo âl petto.

Poi sorridendo disse: Â«Io son Manfredi,
nepote di Costanza imperadrice;
ondâ io ti priego che, quando tu riedi,

vadi a mia bella figlia, genitrice
de lâonor di Cicilia e dâAragona,
e dichi âl vero a lei, sâaltro si dice.

Poscia châio ebbi rotta la persona
di due punte mortali, io mi rendei,
piangendo, a quei che volontier perdona.

Orribil furon li peccati miei;
ma la bontÃ  infinita ha sÃ¬ gran braccia,
che prende ciÃ² che si rivolge a lei.

Se âl pastor di Cosenza, che a la caccia
di me fu messo per Clemente allora,
avesse in Dio ben letta questa faccia,

lâossa del corpo mio sarieno ancora
in co del ponte presso a Benevento,
sotto la guardia de la grave mora.

Or le bagna la pioggia e move il vento
di fuor dal regno, quasi lungo âl Verde,
dovâ eâ le trasmutÃ² a lume spento.

Per lor maladizion sÃ¬ non si perde,
che non possa tornar, lâetterno amore,
mentre che la speranza ha fior del verde.

Vero Ã¨ che quale in contumacia more
di Santa Chiesa, ancor châal fin si penta,
star li convien da questa ripa in fore,

per ognun tempo châelli Ã¨ stato, trenta,
in sua presunzÃ¯on, se tal decreto
piÃ¹ corto per buon prieghi non diventa.

Vedi oggimai se tu mi puoi far lieto,
revelando a la mia buona Costanza
come mâhai visto, e anco esto divieto;

chÃ© qui per quei di lÃ  molto sâavanzaÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto IV


Quando per dilettanze o ver per doglie,
che alcuna virtÃ¹ nostra comprenda,
lâanima bene ad essa si raccoglie,

par châa nulla potenza piÃ¹ intenda;
e questo Ã¨ contra quello error che crede
châunâanima sovrâ altra in noi sâaccenda.

E perÃ², quando sâode cosa o vede
che tegna forte a sÃ© lâanima volta,
vassene âl tempo e lâuom non se nâavvede;

châaltra potenza Ã¨ quella che lâascolta,
e altra Ã¨ quella câha lâanima intera:
questa Ã¨ quasi legata e quella Ã¨ sciolta.

Di ciÃ² ebbâ io esperÃ¯enza vera,
udendo quello spirto e ammirando;
chÃ© ben cinquanta gradi salito era

lo sole, e io non mâera accorto, quando
venimmo ove quellâ anime ad una
gridaro a noi: Â«Qui Ã¨ vostro dimandoÂ».

Maggiore aperta molte volte impruna
con una forcatella di sue spine
lâuom de la villa quando lâuva imbruna,

che non era la calla onde salÃ¬ne
lo duca mio, e io appresso, soli,
come da noi la schiera si partÃ¬ne.

Vassi in Sanleo e discendesi in Noli,
montasi su in Bismantova e ân Cacume
con esso i piÃ¨; ma qui convien châom voli;

dico con lâale snelle e con le piume
del gran disio, di retro a quel condotto
che speranza mi dava e facea lume.

Noi salavam per entro âl sasso rotto,
e dâogne lato ne stringea lo stremo,
e piedi e man volea il suol di sotto.

Poi che noi fummo in su lâorlo suppremo
de lâalta ripa, a la scoperta piaggia,
Â«Maestro mioÂ», dissâ io, Â«che via faremo?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«Nessun tuo passo caggia;
pur su al monte dietro a me acquista,
fin che nâappaia alcuna scorta saggiaÂ».

Lo sommo erâ alto che vincea la vista,
e la costa superba piÃ¹ assai
che da mezzo quadrante a centro lista.

Io era lasso, quando cominciai:
Â«O dolce padre, volgiti, e rimira
comâ io rimango sol, se non restaiÂ».

Â«Figliuol mioÂ», disse, Â«infin quivi ti tiraÂ»,
additandomi un balzo poco in sÃ¹e
che da quel lato il poggio tutto gira.

SÃ¬ mi spronaron le parole sue,
châiâ mi sforzai carpando appresso lui,
tanto che âl cinghio sotto i piÃ¨ mi fue.

A seder ci ponemmo ivi ambedui
vÃ²lti a levante ondâ eravam saliti,
che suole a riguardar giovare altrui.

Li occhi prima drizzai ai bassi liti;
poscia li alzai al sole, e ammirava
che da sinistra nâeravam feriti.

Ben sâavvide il poeta châÃ¯o stava
stupido tutto al carro de la luce,
ove tra noi e Aquilone intrava.

Ondâ elli a me: Â«Se Castore e Poluce
fossero in compagnia di quello specchio
che sÃ¹ e giÃ¹ del suo lume conduce,

tu vedresti il ZodÃ¯aco rubecchio
ancora a lâOrse piÃ¹ stretto rotare,
se non uscisse fuor del cammin vecchio.

Come ciÃ² sia, se âl vuoi poter pensare,
dentro raccolto, imagina SÃ¯Ã²n
con questo monte in su la terra stare

sÃ¬, châamendue hanno un solo orizzÃ²n
e diversi emisperi; onde la strada
che mal non seppe carreggiar FetÃ²n,

vedrai come a costui convien che vada
da lâun, quando a colui da lâaltro fianco,
se lo ântelletto tuo ben chiaro badaÂ».

Â«Certo, maestro mio,Â» dissâ io, Â«unquanco
non vidâ io chiaro sÃ¬ comâ io discerno
lÃ  dove mio ingegno parea manco,

che âl mezzo cerchio del moto superno,
che si chiama Equatore in alcunâ arte,
e che sempre riman tra âl sole e âl verno,

per la ragion che diâ, quinci si parte
verso settentrÃ¯on, quanto li Ebrei
vedevan lui verso la calda parte.

Ma se a te piace, volontier saprei
quanto avemo ad andar; chÃ© âl poggio sale
piÃ¹ che salir non posson li occhi mieiÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«Questa montagna Ã¨ tale,
che sempre al cominciar di sotto Ã¨ grave;
e quantâ om piÃ¹ va sÃ¹, e men fa male.

PerÃ², quandâ ella ti parrÃ  soave
tanto, che sÃ¹ andar ti fia leggero
comâ a seconda giÃ¹ andar per nave,

allor sarai al fin dâesto sentiero;
quivi di riposar lâaffanno aspetta.
PiÃ¹ non rispondo, e questo so per veroÂ».

E comâ elli ebbe sua parola detta,
una voce di presso sonÃ²: Â«Forse
che di sedere in pria avrai distretta!Â».

Al suon di lei ciascun di noi si torse,
e vedemmo a mancina un gran petrone,
del qual nÃ© io nÃ© ei prima sâaccorse.

LÃ  ci traemmo; e ivi eran persone
che si stavano a lâombra dietro al sasso
come lâuom per negghienza a star si pone.

E un di lor, che mi sembiava lasso,
sedeva e abbracciava le ginocchia,
tenendo âl viso giÃ¹ tra esse basso.

Â«O dolce segnor mioÂ», dissâ io, Â«adocchia
colui che mostra sÃ© piÃ¹ negligente
che se pigrizia fosse sua serocchiaÂ».

Allor si volse a noi e puose mente,
movendo âl viso pur su per la coscia,
e disse: Â«Or va tu sÃ¹, che seâ valente!Â».

Conobbi allor chi era, e quella angoscia
che mâavacciava un poco ancor la lena,
non mâimpedÃ¬ lâandare a lui; e poscia

châa lui fuâ giunto, alzÃ² la testa a pena,
dicendo: Â«Hai ben veduto come âl sole
da lâomero sinistro il carro mena?Â».

Li atti suoi pigri e le corte parole
mosser le labbra mie un poco a riso;
poi cominciai: Â«Belacqua, a me non dole

di te omai; ma dimmi: perchÃ© assiso
quiritto seâ? attendi tu iscorta,
o pur lo modo usato tâhaâ ripriso?Â».

Ed elli: Â«O frate, andar in sÃ¹ che porta?
chÃ© non mi lascerebbe ire aâ martÃ¬ri
lâangel di Dio che siede in su la porta.

Prima convien che tanto il ciel mâaggiri
di fuor da essa, quanto fece in vita,
per châio ândugiai al fine i buon sospiri,

se orazÃ¯one in prima non mâaita
che surga sÃ¹ di cuor che in grazia viva;
lâaltra che val, che ân ciel non Ã¨ udita?Â».

E giÃ  il poeta innanzi mi saliva,
e dicea: Â«Vienne omai; vedi châÃ¨ tocco
meridÃ¯an dal sole e a la riva

cuopre la notte giÃ  col piÃ¨ MorroccoÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto V


Io era giÃ  da quellâ ombre partito,
e seguitava lâorme del mio duca,
quando di retro a me, drizzando âl dito,

una gridÃ²: Â«Veâ che non par che luca
lo raggio da sinistra a quel di sotto,
e come vivo par che si conduca!Â».

Li occhi rivolsi al suon di questo motto,
e vidile guardar per maraviglia
pur me, pur me, e âl lume châera rotto.

Â«PerchÃ© lâanimo tuo tanto sâimpigliaÂ»,
disse âl maestro, Â«che lâandare allenti?
che ti fa ciÃ² che quivi si pispiglia?

Vien dietro a me, e lascia dir le genti:
sta come torre ferma, che non crolla
giÃ  mai la cima per soffiar di venti;

chÃ© sempre lâomo in cui pensier rampolla
sovra pensier, da sÃ© dilunga il segno,
perchÃ© la foga lâun de lâaltro insollaÂ».

Che potea io ridir, se non Â«Io vegnoÂ»?
Dissilo, alquanto del color consperso
che fa lâuom di perdon talvolta degno.

E ântanto per la costa di traverso
venivan genti innanzi a noi un poco,
cantando âMiserereâ a verso a verso.

Quando sâaccorser châiâ non dava loco
per lo mio corpo al trapassar dâi raggi,
mutar lor canto in un Â«oh!Â» lungo e roco;

e due di loro, in forma di messaggi,
corsero incontrâ a noi e dimandarne:
Â«Di vostra condizion fatene saggiÂ».

E âl mio maestro: Â«Voi potete andarne
e ritrarre a color che vi mandaro
che âl corpo di costui Ã¨ vera carne.

Se per veder la sua ombra restaro,
comâ io avviso, assai Ã¨ lor risposto:
fÃ ccianli onore, ed esser puÃ² lor caroÂ».

Vapori accesi non vidâ io sÃ¬ tosto
di prima notte mai fender sereno,
nÃ©, sol calando, nuvole dâagosto,

che color non tornasser suso in meno;
e, giunti lÃ , con li altri a noi dier volta,
come schiera che scorre sanza freno.

Â«Questa gente che preme a noi Ã¨ molta,
e vegnonti a pregarÂ», disse âl poeta:
Â«perÃ² pur va, e in andando ascoltaÂ».

Â«O anima che vai per esser lieta
con quelle membra con le quai nascestiÂ»,
venian gridando, Â«un poco il passo queta.

Guarda sâalcun di noi unqua vedesti,
sÃ¬ che di lui di lÃ  novella porti:
deh, perchÃ© vai? deh, perchÃ© non tâarresti?

Noi fummo tutti giÃ  per forza morti,
e peccatori infino a lâultima ora;
quivi lume del ciel ne fece accorti,

sÃ¬ che, pentendo e perdonando, fora
di vita uscimmo a Dio pacificati,
che del disio di sÃ© veder nâaccoraÂ».

E io: Â«PerchÃ© neâ vostri visi guati,
non riconosco alcun; ma sâa voi piace
cosa châio possa, spiriti ben nati,

voi dite, e io farÃ² per quella pace
che, dietro aâ piedi di sÃ¬ fatta guida,
di mondo in mondo cercar mi si faceÂ».

E uno incominciÃ²: Â«Ciascun si fida
del beneficio tuo sanza giurarlo,
pur che âl voler nonpossa non ricida.

Ondâ io, che solo innanzi a li altri parlo,
ti priego, se mai vedi quel paese
che siede tra Romagna e quel di Carlo,

che tu mi sie di tuoi prieghi cortese
in Fano, sÃ¬ che ben per me sâadori
pur châiâ possa purgar le gravi offese.

Quindi fuâ io; ma li profondi fÃ³ri
ondâ uscÃ¬ âl sangue in sul quale io sedea,
fatti mi fuoro in grembo a li Antenori,

lÃ  dovâ io piÃ¹ sicuro esser credea:
quel da Esti il fÃ© far, che mâavea in ira
assai piÃ¹ lÃ  che dritto non volea.

Ma sâio fosse fuggito inverâ la Mira,
quando fuâ sovragiunto ad OrÃ¯aco,
ancor sarei di lÃ  dove si spira.

Corsi al palude, e le cannucce e âl braco
mâimpigliar sÃ¬ châiâ caddi; e lÃ¬ vidâ io
de le mie vene farsi in terra lacoÂ».

Poi disse un altro: Â«Deh, se quel disio
si compia che ti tragge a lâalto monte,
con buona pÃ¯etate aiuta il mio!

Io fui di Montefeltro, io son Bonconte;
Giovanna o altri non ha di me cura;
per châio vo tra costor con bassa fronteÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Qual forza o qual ventura
ti travÃ¯Ã² sÃ¬ fuor di Campaldino,
che non si seppe mai tua sepultura?Â».

Â«Oh!Â», rispuosâ elli, Â«a piÃ¨ del Casentino
traversa unâacqua câha nome lâArchiano,
che sovra lâErmo nasce in Apennino.

LÃ  âve âl vocabol suo diventa vano,
arrivaâ io forato ne la gola,
fuggendo a piede e sanguinando il piano.

Quivi perdei la vista e la parola;
nel nome di Maria finiâ, e quivi
caddi, e rimase la mia carne sola.

Io dirÃ² vero, e tu âl ridÃ¬ tra â vivi:
lâangel di Dio mi prese, e quel dâinferno
gridava: âO tu del ciel, perchÃ© mi privi?

Tu te ne porti di costui lâetterno
per una lagrimetta che âl mi toglie;
ma io farÃ² de lâaltro altro governo!â.

Ben sai come ne lâaere si raccoglie
quellâ umido vapor che in acqua riede,
tosto che sale dove âl freddo il coglie.

Giunse quel mal voler che pur mal chiede
con lo ântelletto, e mosse il fummo e âl vento
per la virtÃ¹ che sua natura diede.

Indi la valle, come âl dÃ¬ fu spento,
da Pratomagno al gran giogo coperse
di nebbia; e âl ciel di sopra fece intento,

sÃ¬ che âl pregno aere in acqua si converse;
la pioggia cadde, e aâ fossati venne
di lei ciÃ² che la terra non sofferse;

e come ai rivi grandi si convenne,
verâ lo fiume real tanto veloce
si ruinÃ², che nulla la ritenne.

Lo corpo mio gelato in su la foce
trovÃ² lâArchian rubesto; e quel sospinse
ne lâArno, e sciolse al mio petto la croce

châiâ feâ di me quando âl dolor mi vinse;
voltÃ²mmi per le ripe e per lo fondo,
poi di sua preda mi coperse e cinseÂ».

Â«Deh, quando tu sarai tornato al mondo
e riposato de la lunga viaÂ»,
seguitÃ² âl terzo spirito al secondo,

Â«ricorditi di me, che son la Pia;
Siena mi fÃ©, disfecemi Maremma:
salsi colui che ânnanellata pria

disposando mâavea con la sua gemmaÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto VI


Quando si parte il gioco de la zara,
colui che perde si riman dolente,
repetendo le volte, e tristo impara;

con lâaltro se ne va tutta la gente;
qual va dinanzi, e qual di dietro il prende,
e qual dallato li si reca a mente;

el non sâarresta, e questo e quello intende;
a cui porge la man, piÃ¹ non fa pressa;
e cosÃ¬ da la calca si difende.

Tal era io in quella turba spessa,
volgendo a loro, e qua e lÃ , la faccia,
e promettendo mi sciogliea da essa.

Quivâ era lâAretin che da le braccia
fiere di Ghin di Tacco ebbe la morte,
e lâaltro châannegÃ² correndo in caccia.

Quivi pregava con le mani sporte
Federigo Novello, e quel da Pisa
che fÃ© parer lo buon Marzucco forte.

Vidi conte Orso e lâanima divisa
dal corpo suo per astio e per inveggia,
comâ eâ dicea, non per colpa commisa;

Pier da la Broccia dico; e qui proveggia,
mentrâ Ã¨ di qua, la donna di Brabante,
sÃ¬ che perÃ² non sia di peggior greggia.

Come libero fui da tutte quante
quellâ ombre che pregar pur châaltri prieghi,
sÃ¬ che sâavacci lor divenir sante,

io cominciai: Â«El par che tu mi nieghi,
o luce mia, espresso in alcun testo
che decreto del cielo orazion pieghi;

e questa gente prega pur di questo:
sarebbe dunque loro speme vana,
o non mâÃ¨ âl detto tuo ben manifesto?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«La mia scrittura Ã¨ piana;
e la speranza di costor non falla,
se ben si guarda con la mente sana;

chÃ© cima di giudicio non sâavvalla
perchÃ© foco dâamor compia in un punto
ciÃ² che deâ sodisfar chi qui sâastalla;

e lÃ  dovâ io fermai cotesto punto,
non sâammendava, per pregar, difetto,
perchÃ© âl priego da Dio era disgiunto.

Veramente a cosÃ¬ alto sospetto
non ti fermar, se quella nol ti dice
che lume fia tra âl vero e lo ântelletto.

Non so se ântendi: io dico di Beatrice;
tu la vedrai di sopra, in su la vetta
di questo monte, ridere e feliceÂ».

E io: Â«Segnore, andiamo a maggior fretta,
chÃ© giÃ  non mâaffatico come dianzi,
e vedi omai che âl poggio lâombra gettaÂ».

Â«Noi anderem con questo giorno innanziÂ»,
rispuose, Â«quanto piÃ¹ potremo omai;
ma âl fatto Ã¨ dâaltra forma che non stanzi.

Prima che sie lÃ  sÃ¹, tornar vedrai
colui che giÃ  si cuopre de la costa,
sÃ¬ che â suoi raggi tu romper non fai.

Ma vedi lÃ  unâanima che, posta
sola soletta, inverso noi riguarda:
quella ne ânsegnerÃ  la via piÃ¹ tostaÂ».

Venimmo a lei: o anima lombarda,
come ti stavi altera e disdegnosa
e nel mover de li occhi onesta e tarda!

Ella non ci dicÃ«a alcuna cosa,
ma lasciavane gir, solo sguardando
a guisa di leon quando si posa.

Pur Virgilio si trasse a lei, pregando
che ne mostrasse la miglior salita;
e quella non rispuose al suo dimando,

ma di nostro paese e de la vita
ci ânchiese; e âl dolce duca incominciava
Â«MantÃ¼a . . . Â», e lâombra, tutta in sÃ© romita,

surse verâ lui del loco ove pria stava,
dicendo: Â«O Mantoano, io son Sordello
de la tua terra!Â»; e lâun lâaltro abbracciava.

Ahi serva Italia, di dolore ostello,
nave sanza nocchiere in gran tempesta,
non donna di province, ma bordello!

Quellâ anima gentil fu cosÃ¬ presta,
sol per lo dolce suon de la sua terra,
di fare al cittadin suo quivi festa;

e ora in te non stanno sanza guerra
li vivi tuoi, e lâun lâaltro si rode
di quei châun muro e una fossa serra.

Cerca, misera, intorno da le prode
le tue marine, e poi ti guarda in seno,
sâalcuna parte in te di pace gode.

Che val perchÃ© ti racconciasse il freno
IustinÃ¯ano, se la sella Ã¨ vÃ²ta?
Sanzâ esso fora la vergogna meno.

Ahi gente che dovresti esser devota,
e lasciar seder Cesare in la sella,
se bene intendi ciÃ² che Dio ti nota,

guarda come esta fiera Ã¨ fatta fella
per non esser corretta da li sproni,
poi che ponesti mano a la predella.

O Alberto tedesco châabbandoni
costei châÃ¨ fatta indomita e selvaggia,
e dovresti inforcar li suoi arcioni,

giusto giudicio da le stelle caggia
sovra âl tuo sangue, e sia novo e aperto,
tal che âl tuo successor temenza nâaggia!

Châavete tu e âl tuo padre sofferto,
per cupidigia di costÃ  distretti,
che âl giardin de lo âmperio sia diserto.

Vieni a veder Montecchi e Cappelletti,
Monaldi e Filippeschi, uom sanza cura:
color giÃ  tristi, e questi con sospetti!

Vien, crudel, vieni, e vedi la pressura
dâi tuoi gentili, e cura lor magagne;
e vedrai Santafior comâ Ã¨ oscura!

Vieni a veder la tua Roma che piagne
vedova e sola, e dÃ¬ e notte chiama:
Â«Cesare mio, perchÃ© non mâaccompagne?Â».

Vieni a veder la gente quanto sâama!
e se nulla di noi pietÃ  ti move,
a vergognar ti vien de la tua fama.

E se licito mâÃ¨, o sommo Giove
che fosti in terra per noi crucifisso,
son li giusti occhi tuoi rivolti altrove?

O Ã¨ preparazion che ne lâabisso
del tuo consiglio fai per alcun bene
in tutto de lâaccorger nostro scisso?

ChÃ© le cittÃ  dâItalia tutte piene
son di tiranni, e un Marcel diventa
ogne villan che parteggiando viene.

Fiorenza mia, ben puoi esser contenta
di questa digression che non ti tocca,
mercÃ© del popol tuo che si argomenta.

Molti han giustizia in cuore, e tardi scocca
per non venir sanza consiglio a lâarco;
ma il popol tuo lâha in sommo de la bocca.

Molti rifiutan lo comune incarco;
ma il popol tuo solicito risponde
sanza chiamare, e grida: Â«Iâ mi sobbarco!Â».

Or ti fa lieta, chÃ© tu hai ben onde:
tu ricca, tu con pace e tu con senno!
Sâio dico âl ver, lâeffetto nol nasconde.

Atene e Lacedemona, che fenno
lâantiche leggi e furon sÃ¬ civili,
fecero al viver bene un picciol cenno

verso di te, che fai tanto sottili
provedimenti, châa mezzo novembre
non giugne quel che tu dâottobre fili.

Quante volte, del tempo che rimembre,
legge, moneta, officio e costume
hai tu mutato, e rinovate membre!

E se ben ti ricordi e vedi lume,
vedrai te somigliante a quella inferma
che non puÃ² trovar posa in su le piume,

ma con dar volta suo dolore scherma.



Purgatorio Â· Canto VII


Poscia che lâaccoglienze oneste e liete
furo iterate tre e quattro volte,
Sordel si trasse, e disse: Â«Voi, chi siete?Â».

Â«Anzi che a questo monte fosser volte
lâanime degne di salire a Dio,
fur lâossa mie per Ottavian sepolte.

Io son Virgilio; e per nullâ altro rio
lo ciel perdei che per non aver fÃ©Â».
CosÃ¬ rispuose allora il duca mio.

Qual Ã¨ colui che cosa innanzi sÃ©
sÃ¹bita vede ondâ eâ si maraviglia,
che crede e non, dicendo Â«Ella Ã¨ . . . non Ã¨ . . . Â»,

tal parve quelli; e poi chinÃ² le ciglia,
e umilmente ritornÃ² verâ lui,
e abbracciÃ²l lÃ  âve âl minor sâappiglia.

Â«O gloria di LatinÂ», disse, Â«per cui
mostrÃ² ciÃ² che potea la lingua nostra,
o pregio etterno del loco ondâ io fui,

qual merito o qual grazia mi ti mostra?
Sâio son dâudir le tue parole degno,
dimmi se vien dâinferno, e di qual chiostraÂ».

Â«Per tuttâ i cerchi del dolente regnoÂ»,
rispuose lui, Â«son io di qua venuto;
virtÃ¹ del ciel mi mosse, e con lei vegno.

Non per far, ma per non fare ho perduto
a veder lâalto Sol che tu disiri
e che fu tardi per me conosciuto.

Luogo Ã¨ lÃ  giÃ¹ non tristo di martÃ¬ri,
ma di tenebre solo, ove i lamenti
non suonan come guai, ma son sospiri.

Quivi sto io coi pargoli innocenti
dai denti morsi de la morte avante
che fosser da lâumana colpa essenti;

quivi sto io con quei che le tre sante
virtÃ¹ non si vestiro, e sanza vizio
conobber lâaltre e seguir tutte quante.

Ma se tu sai e puoi, alcuno indizio
dÃ  noi per che venir possiam piÃ¹ tosto
lÃ  dove purgatorio ha dritto inizioÂ».

Rispuose: Â«Loco certo non câÃ¨ posto;
licito mâÃ¨ andar suso e intorno;
per quanto ir posso, a guida mi tâaccosto.

Ma vedi giÃ  come dichina il giorno,
e andar sÃ¹ di notte non si puote;
perÃ² Ã¨ buon pensar di bel soggiorno.

Anime sono a destra qua remote;
se mi consenti, io ti merrÃ² ad esse,
e non sanza diletto ti fier noteÂ».

Â«Comâ Ã¨ ciÃ²?Â», fu risposto. Â«Chi volesse
salir di notte, fora elli impedito
dâaltrui, o non sarria chÃ© non potesse?Â».

E âl buon Sordello in terra fregÃ² âl dito,
dicendo: Â«Vedi? sola questa riga
non varcheresti dopo âl sol partito:

non perÃ² châaltra cosa desse briga,
che la notturna tenebra, ad ir suso;
quella col nonpoder la voglia intriga.

Ben si poria con lei tornare in giuso
e passeggiar la costa intorno errando,
mentre che lâorizzonte il dÃ¬ tien chiusoÂ».

Allora il mio segnor, quasi ammirando,
Â«MenaneÂ», disse, Â«dunque lÃ  âve dici
châaver si puÃ² diletto dimorandoÂ».

Poco allungati câeravam di lici,
quandâ io mâaccorsi che âl monte era scemo,
a guisa che i vallon li sceman quici.

Â«ColÃ Â», disse quellâ ombra, Â«nâanderemo
dove la costa face di sÃ© grembo;
e lÃ  il novo giorno attenderemoÂ».

Tra erto e piano era un sentiero schembo,
che ne condusse in fianco de la lacca,
lÃ  dove piÃ¹ châa mezzo muore il lembo.

Oro e argento fine, cocco e biacca,
indaco, legno lucido e sereno,
fresco smeraldo in lâora che si fiacca,

da lâerba e da li fior, dentrâ a quel seno
posti, ciascun saria di color vinto,
come dal suo maggiore Ã¨ vinto il meno.

Non avea pur natura ivi dipinto,
ma di soavitÃ  di mille odori
vi facea uno incognito e indistinto.

âSalve, Reginaâ in sul verde e ân suâ fiori
quindi seder cantando anime vidi,
che per la valle non parean di fuori.

Â«Prima che âl poco sole omai sâannidiÂ»,
cominciÃ² âl Mantoan che ci avea vÃ²lti,
Â«tra color non vogliate châio vi guidi.

Di questo balzo meglio li atti e â volti
conoscerete voi di tutti quanti,
che ne la lama giÃ¹ tra essi accolti.

Colui che piÃ¹ siede alto e fa sembianti
dâaver negletto ciÃ² che far dovea,
e che non move bocca a li altrui canti,

Rodolfo imperador fu, che potea
sanar le piaghe câhanno Italia morta,
sÃ¬ che tardi per altri si ricrea.

Lâaltro che ne la vista lui conforta,
resse la terra dove lâacqua nasce
che Molta in Albia, e Albia in mar ne porta:

Ottacchero ebbe nome, e ne le fasce
fu meglio assai che Vincislao suo figlio
barbuto, cui lussuria e ozio pasce.

E quel nasetto che stretto a consiglio
par con colui câha sÃ¬ benigno aspetto,
morÃ¬ fuggendo e disfiorando il giglio:

guardate lÃ  come si batte il petto!
Lâaltro vedete câha fatto a la guancia
de la sua palma, sospirando, letto.

Padre e suocero son del mal di Francia:
sanno la vita sua viziata e lorda,
e quindi viene il duol che sÃ¬ li lancia.

Quel che par sÃ¬ membruto e che sâaccorda,
cantando, con colui dal maschio naso,
dâogne valor portÃ² cinta la corda;

e se re dopo lui fosse rimaso
lo giovanetto che retro a lui siede,
ben andava il valor di vaso in vaso,

che non si puote dir de lâaltre rede;
Iacomo e Federigo hanno i reami;
del retaggio miglior nessun possiede.

Rade volte risurge per li rami
lâumana probitate; e questo vole
quei che la dÃ , perchÃ© da lui si chiami.

Anche al nasuto vanno mie parole
non men châa lâaltro, Pier, che con lui canta,
onde Puglia e Proenza giÃ  si dole.

Tantâ Ã¨ del seme suo minor la pianta,
quanto, piÃ¹ che Beatrice e Margherita,
Costanza di marito ancor si vanta.

Vedete il re de la semplice vita
seder lÃ  solo, Arrigo dâInghilterra:
questi ha neâ rami suoi migliore uscita.

Quel che piÃ¹ basso tra costor sâatterra,
guardando in suso, Ã¨ Guiglielmo marchese,
per cui e Alessandria e la sua guerra

fa pianger Monferrato e CanaveseÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto VIII


Era giÃ  lâora che volge il disio
ai navicanti e ântenerisce il core
lo dÃ¬ câhan detto ai dolci amici addio;

e che lo novo peregrin dâamore
punge, se ode squilla di lontano
che paia il giorno pianger che si more;

quandâ io incominciai a render vano
lâudire e a mirare una de lâalme
surta, che lâascoltar chiedea con mano.

Ella giunse e levÃ² ambo le palme,
ficcando li occhi verso lâorÃ¯ente,
come dicesse a Dio: âDâaltro non calmeâ.

âTe lucis anteâ sÃ¬ devotamente
le uscÃ¬o di bocca e con sÃ¬ dolci note,
che fece me a me uscir di mente;

e lâaltre poi dolcemente e devote
seguitar lei per tutto lâinno intero,
avendo li occhi a le superne rote.

Aguzza qui, lettor, ben li occhi al vero,
chÃ© âl velo Ã¨ ora ben tanto sottile,
certo che âl trapassar dentro Ã¨ leggero.

Io vidi quello essercito gentile
tacito poscia riguardare in sÃ¹e,
quasi aspettando, palido e umÃ¬le;

e vidi uscir de lâalto e scender giÃ¹e
due angeli con due spade affocate,
tronche e private de le punte sue.

Verdi come fogliette pur mo nate
erano in veste, che da verdi penne
percosse traean dietro e ventilate.

Lâun poco sovra noi a star si venne,
e lâaltro scese in lâopposita sponda,
sÃ¬ che la gente in mezzo si contenne.

Ben discernÃ«a in lor la testa bionda;
ma ne la faccia lâocchio si smarria,
come virtÃ¹ châa troppo si confonda.

Â«Ambo vegnon del grembo di MariaÂ»,
disse Sordello, Â«a guardia de la valle,
per lo serpente che verrÃ  vie viaÂ».

Ondâ io, che non sapeva per qual calle,
mi volsi intorno, e stretto mâaccostai,
tutto gelato, a le fidate spalle.

E Sordello anco: Â«Or avvalliamo omai
tra le grandi ombre, e parleremo ad esse;
grazÃ¯oso fia lor vedervi assaiÂ».

Solo tre passi credo châiâ scendesse,
e fui di sotto, e vidi un che mirava
pur me, come conoscer mi volesse.

Tempâ era giÃ  che lâaere sâannerava,
ma non sÃ¬ che tra li occhi suoi e â miei
non dichiarisse ciÃ² che pria serrava.

Verâ me si fece, e io verâ lui mi fei:
giudice Nin gentil, quanto mi piacque
quando ti vidi non esser tra â rei!

Nullo bel salutar tra noi si tacque;
poi dimandÃ²: Â«Quantâ Ã¨ che tu venisti
a piÃ¨ del monte per le lontane acque?Â».

Â«Oh!Â», dissâ io lui, Â«per entro i luoghi tristi
venni stamane, e sono in prima vita,
ancor che lâaltra, sÃ¬ andando, acquistiÂ».

E come fu la mia risposta udita,
Sordello ed elli in dietro si raccolse
come gente di sÃ¹bito smarrita.

Lâuno a Virgilio e lâaltro a un si volse
che sedea lÃ¬, gridando: Â«SÃ¹, Currado!
vieni a veder che Dio per grazia volseÂ».

Poi, vÃ²lto a me: Â«Per quel singular grado
che tu dei a colui che sÃ¬ nasconde
lo suo primo perchÃ©, che non lÃ¬ Ã¨ guado,

quando sarai di lÃ  da le larghe onde,
dÃ¬ a Giovanna mia che per me chiami
lÃ  dove a li ânnocenti si risponde.

Non credo che la sua madre piÃ¹ mâami,
poscia che trasmutÃ² le bianche bende,
le quai convien che, misera!, ancor brami.

Per lei assai di lieve si comprende
quanto in femmina foco dâamor dura,
se lâocchio o âl tatto spesso non lâaccende.

Non le farÃ  sÃ¬ bella sepultura
la vipera che Melanesi accampa,
comâ avria fatto il gallo di GalluraÂ».

CosÃ¬ dicea, segnato de la stampa,
nel suo aspetto, di quel dritto zelo
che misuratamente in core avvampa.

Li occhi miei ghiotti andavan pur al cielo,
pur lÃ  dove le stelle son piÃ¹ tarde,
sÃ¬ come rota piÃ¹ presso a lo stelo.

E âl duca mio: Â«Figliuol, che lÃ  sÃ¹ guarde?Â».
E io a lui: Â«A quelle tre facelle
di che âl polo di qua tutto quanto ardeÂ».

Ondâ elli a me: Â«Le quattro chiare stelle
che vedevi staman, son di lÃ  basse,
e queste son salite ovâ eran quelleÂ».

Comâ ei parlava, e Sordello a sÃ© il trasse
dicendo: Â«Vedi lÃ  âl nostro avversaroÂ»;
e drizzÃ² il dito perchÃ© ân lÃ  guardasse.

Da quella parte onde non ha riparo
la picciola vallea, era una biscia,
forse qual diede ad Eva il cibo amaro.

Tra lâerba e â fior venÃ¬a la mala striscia,
volgendo ad ora ad or la testa, e âl dosso
leccando come bestia che si liscia.

Io non vidi, e perÃ² dicer non posso,
come mosser li astor celestÃ¯ali;
ma vidi bene e lâuno e lâaltro mosso.

Sentendo fender lâaere a le verdi ali,
fuggÃ¬ âl serpente, e li angeli dier volta,
suso a le poste rivolando iguali.

Lâombra che sâera al giudice raccolta
quando chiamÃ², per tutto quello assalto
punto non fu da me guardare sciolta.

Â«Se la lucerna che ti mena in alto
truovi nel tuo arbitrio tanta cera
quantâ Ã¨ mestiere infino al sommo smaltoÂ»,

cominciÃ² ella, Â«se novella vera
di Val di Magra o di parte vicina
sai, dillo a me, che giÃ  grande lÃ  era.

Fui chiamato Currado Malaspina;
non son lâantico, ma di lui discesi;
aâ miei portai lâamor che qui raffinaÂ».

Â«Oh!Â», dissâ io lui, Â«per li vostri paesi
giÃ  mai non fui; ma dove si dimora
per tutta Europa châei non sien palesi?

La fama che la vostra casa onora,
grida i segnori e grida la contrada,
sÃ¬ che ne sa chi non vi fu ancora;

e io vi giuro, sâio di sopra vada,
che vostra gente onrata non si sfregia
del pregio de la borsa e de la spada.

Uso e natura sÃ¬ la privilegia,
che, perchÃ© il capo reo il mondo torca,
sola va dritta e âl mal cammin dispregiaÂ».

Ed elli: Â«Or va; che âl sol non si ricorca
sette volte nel letto che âl Montone
con tutti e quattro i piÃ¨ cuopre e inforca,

che cotesta cortese oppinÃ¯one
ti fia chiavata in mezzo de la testa
con maggior chiovi che dâaltrui sermone,

se corso di giudicio non sâarrestaÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto IX


La concubina di Titone antico
giÃ  sâimbiancava al balco dâorÃ¯ente,
fuor de le braccia del suo dolce amico;

di gemme la sua fronte era lucente,
poste in figura del freddo animale
che con la coda percuote la gente;

e la notte, deâ passi con che sale,
fatti avea due nel loco ovâ eravamo,
e âl terzo giÃ  chinava in giuso lâale;

quandâ io, che meco avea di quel dâAdamo,
vinto dal sonno, in su lâerba inchinai
lÃ  âve giÃ  tutti e cinque sedavamo.

Ne lâora che comincia i tristi lai
la rondinella presso a la mattina,
forse a memoria deâ suoâ primi guai,

e che la mente nostra, peregrina
piÃ¹ da la carne e men daâ pensier presa,
a le sue visÃ¯on quasi Ã¨ divina,

in sogno mi parea veder sospesa
unâaguglia nel ciel con penne dâoro,
con lâali aperte e a calare intesa;

ed esser mi parea lÃ  dove fuoro
abbandonati i suoi da Ganimede,
quando fu ratto al sommo consistoro.

Fra me pensava: âForse questa fiede
pur qui per uso, e forse dâaltro loco
disdegna di portarne suso in piedeâ.

Poi mi parea che, poi rotata un poco,
terribil come folgor discendesse,
e me rapisse suso infino al foco.

Ivi parea che ella e io ardesse;
e sÃ¬ lo âncendio imaginato cosse,
che convenne che âl sonno si rompesse.

Non altrimenti Achille si riscosse,
li occhi svegliati rivolgendo in giro
e non sappiendo lÃ  dove si fosse,

quando la madre da ChirÃ³n a Schiro
trafuggÃ² lui dormendo in le sue braccia,
lÃ  onde poi li Greci il dipartiro;

che mi scossâ io, sÃ¬ come da la faccia
mi fuggÃ¬ âl sonno, e diventaâ ismorto,
come fa lâuom che, spaventato, agghiaccia.

Dallato mâera solo il mio conforto,
e âl sole erâ alto giÃ  piÃ¹ che due ore,
e âl viso mâera a la marina torto.

Â«Non aver temaÂ», disse il mio segnore;
Â«fatti sicur, chÃ© noi semo a buon punto;
non stringer, ma rallarga ogne vigore.

Tu seâ omai al purgatorio giunto:
vedi lÃ  il balzo che âl chiude dintorno;
vedi lâentrata lÃ  âve par digiunto.

Dianzi, ne lâalba che procede al giorno,
quando lâanima tua dentro dormia,
sovra li fiori ondâ Ã¨ lÃ  giÃ¹ addorno

venne una donna, e disse: âIâ son Lucia;
lasciatemi pigliar costui che dorme;
sÃ¬ lâagevolerÃ² per la sua viaâ.

Sordel rimase e lâaltre genti forme;
ella ti tolse, e come âl dÃ¬ fu chiaro,
sen venne suso; e io per le sue orme.

Qui ti posÃ², ma pria mi dimostraro
li occhi suoi belli quella intrata aperta;
poi ella e âl sonno ad una se nâandaroÂ».

A guisa dâuom che ân dubbio si raccerta
e che muta in conforto sua paura,
poi che la veritÃ  li Ã¨ discoperta,

mi cambiaâ io; e come sanza cura
vide me âl duca mio, su per lo balzo
si mosse, e io di rietro inverâ lâaltura.

Lettor, tu vedi ben comâ io innalzo
la mia matera, e perÃ² con piÃ¹ arte
non ti maravigliar sâio la rincalzo.

Noi ci appressammo, ed eravamo in parte
che lÃ  dove pareami prima rotto,
pur come un fesso che muro diparte,

vidi una porta, e tre gradi di sotto
per gire ad essa, di color diversi,
e un portier châancor non facea motto.

E come lâocchio piÃ¹ e piÃ¹ vâapersi,
vidil seder sovra âl grado sovrano,
tal ne la faccia châio non lo soffersi;

e una spada nuda avÃ«a in mano,
che reflettÃ«a i raggi sÃ¬ verâ noi,
châio drizzava spesso il viso in vano.

Â«Dite costinci: che volete voi?Â»,
cominciÃ² elli a dire, Â«ovâ Ã¨ la scorta?
Guardate che âl venir sÃ¹ non vi nÃ²iÂ».

Â«Donna del ciel, di queste cose accortaÂ»,
rispuose âl mio maestro a lui, Â«pur dianzi
ne disse: âAndate lÃ : quivi Ã¨ la portaâÂ».

Â«Ed ella i passi vostri in bene avanziÂ»,
ricominciÃ² il cortese portinaio:
Â«Venite dunque aâ nostri gradi innanziÂ».

LÃ  ne venimmo; e lo scaglion primaio
bianco marmo era sÃ¬ pulito e terso,
châio mi specchiai in esso qual io paio.

Era il secondo tinto piÃ¹ che perso,
dâuna petrina ruvida e arsiccia,
crepata per lo lungo e per traverso.

Lo terzo, che di sopra sâammassiccia,
porfido mi parea, sÃ¬ fiammeggiante
come sangue che fuor di vena spiccia.

Sovra questo tenÃ«a ambo le piante
lâangel di Dio sedendo in su la soglia
che mi sembiava pietra di diamante.

Per li tre gradi sÃ¹ di buona voglia
mi trasse il duca mio, dicendo: Â«Chiedi
umilemente che âl serrame sciogliaÂ».

Divoto mi gittai aâ santi piedi;
misericordia chiesi e châel mâaprisse,
ma tre volte nel petto pria mi diedi.

Sette P ne la fronte mi descrisse
col punton de la spada, e Â«Fa che lavi,
quando seâ dentro, queste piagheÂ» disse.

Cenere, o terra che secca si cavi,
dâun color fora col suo vestimento;
e di sotto da quel trasse due chiavi.

Lâuna era dâoro e lâaltra era dâargento;
pria con la bianca e poscia con la gialla
fece a la porta sÃ¬, châiâ fuâ contento.

Â«Quandunque lâuna dâeste chiavi falla,
che non si volga dritta per la toppaÂ»,
dissâ elli a noi, Â«non sâapre questa calla.

PiÃ¹ cara Ã¨ lâuna; ma lâaltra vuol troppa
dâarte e dâingegno avanti che diserri,
perchâ ella Ã¨ quella che âl nodo digroppa.

Da Pier le tegno; e dissemi châiâ erri
anzi ad aprir châa tenerla serrata,
pur che la gente aâ piedi mi sâatterriÂ».

Poi pinse lâuscio a la porta sacrata,
dicendo: Â«Intrate; ma facciovi accorti
che di fuor torna chi ân dietro si guataÂ».

E quando fuor neâ cardini distorti
li spigoli di quella regge sacra,
che di metallo son sonanti e forti,

non rugghiÃ² sÃ¬ nÃ© si mostrÃ² sÃ¬ acra
TarpÃ«a, come tolto le fu il buono
Metello, per che poi rimase macra.

Io mi rivolsi attento al primo tuono,
e âTe Deum laudamusâ mi parea
udire in voce mista al dolce suono.

Tale imagine a punto mi rendea
ciÃ² châio udiva, qual prender si suole
quando a cantar con organi si stea;

châor sÃ¬ or no sâintendon le parole.



Purgatorio Â· Canto X


Poi fummo dentro al soglio de la porta
che âl mal amor de lâanime disusa,
perchÃ© fa parer dritta la via torta,

sonando la sentiâ esser richiusa;
e sâio avesse li occhi vÃ²lti ad essa,
qual fora stata al fallo degna scusa?

Noi salavam per una pietra fessa,
che si moveva e dâuna e dâaltra parte,
sÃ¬ come lâonda che fugge e sâappressa.

Â«Qui si conviene usare un poco dâarteÂ»,
cominciÃ² âl duca mio, Â«in accostarsi
or quinci, or quindi al lato che si parteÂ».

E questo fece i nostri passi scarsi,
tanto che pria lo scemo de la luna
rigiunse al letto suo per ricorcarsi,

che noi fossimo fuor di quella cruna;
ma quando fummo liberi e aperti
sÃ¹ dove il monte in dietro si rauna,

Ã¯o stancato e amendue incerti
di nostra via, restammo in su un piano
solingo piÃ¹ che strade per diserti.

Da la sua sponda, ove confina il vano,
al piÃ¨ de lâalta ripa che pur sale,
misurrebbe in tre volte un corpo umano;

e quanto lâocchio mio potea trar dâale,
or dal sinistro e or dal destro fianco,
questa cornice mi parea cotale.

LÃ  sÃ¹ non eran mossi i piÃ¨ nostri anco,
quandâ io conobbi quella ripa intorno
che dritto di salita aveva manco,

esser di marmo candido e addorno
dâintagli sÃ¬, che non pur Policleto,
ma la natura lÃ¬ avrebbe scorno.

Lâangel che venne in terra col decreto
de la moltâ anni lagrimata pace,
châaperse il ciel del suo lungo divieto,

dinanzi a noi pareva sÃ¬ verace
quivi intagliato in un atto soave,
che non sembiava imagine che tace.

Giurato si saria châel dicesse âAve!â;
perchÃ© ivâ era imaginata quella
châad aprir lâalto amor volse la chiave;

e avea in atto impressa esta favella
âEcce ancilla DeÃ¯â, propriamente
come figura in cera si suggella.

Â«Non tener pur ad un loco la menteÂ»,
disse âl dolce maestro, che mâavea
da quella parte onde âl cuore ha la gente.

Per châiâ mi mossi col viso, e vedea
di retro da Maria, da quella costa
onde mâera colui che mi movea,

unâaltra storia ne la roccia imposta;
per châio varcai Virgilio, e feâmi presso,
acciÃ² che fosse a li occhi miei disposta.

Era intagliato lÃ¬ nel marmo stesso
lo carro e â buoi, traendo lâarca santa,
per che si teme officio non commesso.

Dinanzi parea gente; e tutta quanta,
partita in sette cori, aâ due mieâ sensi
faceva dir lâun âNoâ, lâaltro âSÃ¬, cantaâ.

Similemente al fummo de li âncensi
che vâera imaginato, li occhi e âl naso
e al sÃ¬ e al no discordi fensi.

LÃ¬ precedeva al benedetto vaso,
trescando alzato, lâumile salmista,
e piÃ¹ e men che re era in quel caso.

Di contra, effigÃ¯ata ad una vista
dâun gran palazzo, MicÃ²l ammirava
sÃ¬ come donna dispettosa e trista.

Iâ mossi i piÃ¨ del loco dovâ io stava,
per avvisar da presso unâaltra istoria,
che di dietro a MicÃ²l mi biancheggiava.

Quivâ era storÃ¯ata lâalta gloria
del roman principato, il cui valore
mosse Gregorio a la sua gran vittoria;

iâ dico di Traiano imperadore;
e una vedovella li era al freno,
di lagrime atteggiata e di dolore.

Intorno a lui parea calcato e pieno
di cavalieri, e lâaguglie ne lâoro
sovrâ essi in vista al vento si movieno.

La miserella intra tutti costoro
pareva dir: Â«Segnor, fammi vendetta
di mio figliuol châÃ¨ morto, ondâ io mâaccoroÂ»;

ed elli a lei rispondere: Â«Or aspetta
tanto châiâ torniÂ»; e quella: Â«Segnor mioÂ»,
come persona in cui dolor sâaffretta,

Â«se tu non torni?Â»; ed ei: Â«Chi fia dovâ io,
la ti farÃ Â»; ed ella: Â«Lâaltrui bene
a te che fia, se âl tuo metti in oblio?Â»;

ondâ elli: Â«Or ti conforta; châei convene
châiâ solva il mio dovere anzi châiâ mova:
giustizia vuole e pietÃ  mi riteneÂ».

Colui che mai non vide cosa nova
produsse esto visibile parlare,
novello a noi perchÃ© qui non si trova.

Mentrâ io mi dilettava di guardare
lâimagini di tante umilitadi,
e per lo fabbro loro a veder care,

Â«Ecco di qua, ma fanno i passi radiÂ»,
mormorava il poeta, Â«molte genti:
questi ne ânvÃ¯eranno a li alti gradiÂ».

Li occhi miei, châa mirare eran contenti
per veder novitadi ondâ eâ son vaghi,
volgendosi verâ lui non furon lenti.

Non voâ perÃ², lettor, che tu ti smaghi
di buon proponimento per udire
come Dio vuol che âl debito si paghi.

Non attender la forma del martÃ¬re:
pensa la succession; pensa châal peggio
oltre la gran sentenza non puÃ² ire.

Io cominciai: Â«Maestro, quel châio veggio
muovere a noi, non mi sembian persone,
e non so che, sÃ¬ nel veder vaneggioÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«La grave condizione
di lor tormento a terra li rannicchia,
sÃ¬ che â miei occhi pria nâebber tencione.

Ma guarda fiso lÃ , e disviticchia
col viso quel che vien sotto a quei sassi:
giÃ  scorger puoi come ciascun si picchiaÂ».

O superbi cristian, miseri lassi,
che, de la vista de la mente infermi,
fidanza avete neâ retrosi passi,

non vâaccorgete voi che noi siam vermi
nati a formar lâangelica farfalla,
che vola a la giustizia sanza schermi?

Di che lâanimo vostro in alto galla,
poi siete quasi antomata in difetto,
sÃ¬ come vermo in cui formazion falla?

Come per sostentar solaio o tetto,
per mensola talvolta una figura
si vede giugner le ginocchia al petto,

la qual fa del non ver vera rancura
nascere ân chi la vede; cosÃ¬ fatti
vidâ io color, quando puosi ben cura.

Vero Ã¨ che piÃ¹ e meno eran contratti
secondo châavien piÃ¹ e meno a dosso;
e qual piÃ¹ pazÃ¯enza avea ne li atti,

piangendo parea dicer: âPiÃ¹ non possoâ.



Purgatorio Â· Canto XI


Â«O Padre nostro, che neâ cieli stai,
non circunscritto, ma per piÃ¹ amore
châai primi effetti di lÃ  sÃ¹ tu hai,

laudato sia âl tuo nome e âl tuo valore
da ogne creatura, comâ Ã¨ degno
di render grazie al tuo dolce vapore.

Vegna verâ noi la pace del tuo regno,
chÃ© noi ad essa non potem da noi,
sâella non vien, con tutto nostro ingegno.

Come del suo voler li angeli tuoi
fan sacrificio a te, cantando osanna,
cosÃ¬ facciano li uomini deâ suoi.

DÃ  oggi a noi la cotidiana manna,
sanza la qual per questo aspro diserto
a retro va chi piÃ¹ di gir sâaffanna.

E come noi lo mal châavem sofferto
perdoniamo a ciascuno, e tu perdona
benigno, e non guardar lo nostro merto.

Nostra virtÃ¹ che di legger sâadona,
non spermentar con lâantico avversaro,
ma libera da lui che sÃ¬ la sprona.

Questâ ultima preghiera, segnor caro,
giÃ  non si fa per noi, chÃ© non bisogna,
ma per color che dietro a noi restaroÂ».

CosÃ¬ a sÃ© e noi buona ramogna
quellâ ombre orando, andavan sotto âl pondo,
simile a quel che talvolta si sogna,

disparmente angosciate tutte a tondo
e lasse su per la prima cornice,
purgando la caligine del mondo.

Se di lÃ  sempre ben per noi si dice,
di qua che dire e far per lor si puote
da quei câhanno al voler buona radice?

Ben si deâ loro atar lavar le note
che portar quinci, sÃ¬ che, mondi e lievi,
possano uscire a le stellate ruote.

Â«Deh, se giustizia e pietÃ  vi disgrievi
tosto, sÃ¬ che possiate muover lâala,
che secondo il disio vostro vi lievi,

mostrate da qual mano inverâ la scala
si va piÃ¹ corto; e se câÃ¨ piÃ¹ dâun varco,
quel ne ânsegnate che men erto cala;

chÃ© questi che vien meco, per lo âncarco
de la carne dâAdamo onde si veste,
al montar sÃ¹, contra sua voglia, Ã¨ parcoÂ».

Le lor parole, che rendero a queste
che dette avea colui cuâ io seguiva,
non fur da cui venisser manifeste;

ma fu detto: Â«A man destra per la riva
con noi venite, e troverete il passo
possibile a salir persona viva.

E sâio non fossi impedito dal sasso
che la cervice mia superba doma,
onde portar convienmi il viso basso,

cotesti, châancor vive e non si noma,
guardereâ io, per veder sâiâ âl conosco,
e per farlo pietoso a questa soma.

Io fui latino e nato dâun gran Tosco:
Guiglielmo Aldobrandesco fu mio padre;
non so se âl nome suo giÃ  mai fu vosco.

Lâantico sangue e lâopere leggiadre
dâi miei maggior mi fer sÃ¬ arrogante,
che, non pensando a la comune madre,

ognâ uomo ebbi in despetto tanto avante,
châio ne moriâ, come i Sanesi sanno,
e sallo in Campagnatico ogne fante.

Io sono Omberto; e non pur a me danno
superbia fa, chÃ© tutti miei consorti
ha ella tratti seco nel malanno.

E qui convien châio questo peso porti
per lei, tanto che a Dio si sodisfaccia,
poi châio nol feâ tra â vivi, qui tra â mortiÂ».

Ascoltando chinai in giÃ¹ la faccia;
e un di lor, non questi che parlava,
si torse sotto il peso che li âmpaccia,

e videmi e conobbemi e chiamava,
tenendo li occhi con fatica fisi
a me che tutto chin con loro andava.

Â«Oh!Â», dissâ io lui, Â«non seâ tu Oderisi,
lâonor dâAgobbio e lâonor di quellâ arte
châalluminar chiamata Ã¨ in Parisi?Â».

Â«FrateÂ», dissâ elli, Â«piÃ¹ ridon le carte
che pennelleggia Franco Bolognese;
lâonore Ã¨ tutto or suo, e mio in parte.

Ben non sareâ io stato sÃ¬ cortese
mentre châio vissi, per lo gran disio
de lâeccellenza ove mio core intese.

Di tal superbia qui si paga il fio;
e ancor non sarei qui, se non fosse
che, possendo peccar, mi volsi a Dio.

Oh vana gloria de lâumane posse!
comâ poco verde in su la cima dura,
se non Ã¨ giunta da lâetati grosse!

Credette Cimabue ne la pittura
tener lo campo, e ora ha Giotto il grido,
sÃ¬ che la fama di colui Ã¨ scura.

CosÃ¬ ha tolto lâuno a lâaltro Guido
la gloria de la lingua; e forse Ã¨ nato
chi lâuno e lâaltro caccerÃ  del nido.

Non Ã¨ il mondan romore altro châun fiato
di vento, châor vien quinci e or vien quindi,
e muta nome perchÃ© muta lato.

Che voce avrai tu piÃ¹, se vecchia scindi
da te la carne, che se fossi morto
anzi che tu lasciassi il âpappoâ e âl âdindiâ,

pria che passin millâ anni? châÃ¨ piÃ¹ corto
spazio a lâetterno, châun muover di ciglia
al cerchio che piÃ¹ tardi in cielo Ã¨ torto.

Colui che del cammin sÃ¬ poco piglia
dinanzi a me, Toscana sonÃ² tutta;
e ora a pena in Siena sen pispiglia,

ondâ era sire quando fu distrutta
la rabbia fiorentina, che superba
fu a quel tempo sÃ¬ comâ ora Ã¨ putta.

La vostra nominanza Ã¨ color dâerba,
che viene e va, e quei la discolora
per cui ella esce de la terra acerbaÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Tuo vero dir mâincora
bona umiltÃ , e gran tumor mâappiani;
ma chi Ã¨ quei di cui tu parlavi ora?Â».

Â«Quelli Ã¨Â», rispuose, Â«Provenzan Salvani;
ed Ã¨ qui perchÃ© fu presuntÃ¼oso
a recar Siena tutta a le sue mani.

Ito Ã¨ cosÃ¬ e va, sanza riposo,
poi che morÃ¬; cotal moneta rende
a sodisfar chi Ã¨ di lÃ  troppo osoÂ».

E io: Â«Se quello spirito châattende,
pria che si penta, lâorlo de la vita,
qua giÃ¹ dimora e qua sÃ¹ non ascende,

se buona orazÃ¯on lui non aita,
prima che passi tempo quanto visse,
come fu la venuta lui largita?Â».

Â«Quando vivea piÃ¹ glorÃ¯osoÂ», disse,
Â«liberamente nel Campo di Siena,
ogne vergogna diposta, sâaffisse;

e lÃ¬, per trar lâamico suo di pena,
châeâ sostenea ne la prigion di Carlo,
si condusse a tremar per ogne vena.

PiÃ¹ non dirÃ², e scuro so che parlo;
ma poco tempo andrÃ , che â tuoi vicini
faranno sÃ¬ che tu potrai chiosarlo.

Questâ opera li tolse quei confiniÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto XII


Di pari, come buoi che vanno a giogo,
mâandava io con quellâ anima carca,
fin che âl sofferse il dolce pedagogo.

Ma quando disse: Â«Lascia lui e varca;
chÃ© qui Ã¨ buono con lâali e coi remi,
quantunque puÃ², ciascun pinger sua barcaÂ»;

dritto sÃ¬ come andar vuolsi rifeâmi
con la persona, avvegna che i pensieri
mi rimanessero e chinati e scemi.

Io mâera mosso, e seguia volontieri
del mio maestro i passi, e amendue
giÃ  mostravam comâ eravam leggeri;

ed el mi disse: Â«Volgi li occhi in giÃ¹e:
buon ti sarÃ , per tranquillar la via,
veder lo letto de le piante tueÂ».

Come, perchÃ© di lor memoria sia,
sovra i sepolti le tombe terragne
portan segnato quel châelli eran pria,

onde lÃ¬ molte volte si ripiagne
per la puntura de la rimembranza,
che solo aâ pÃ¯i dÃ  de le calcagne;

sÃ¬ vidâ io lÃ¬, ma di miglior sembianza
secondo lâartificio, figurato
quanto per via di fuor del monte avanza.

Vedea colui che fu nobil creato
piÃ¹ châaltra creatura, giÃ¹ dal cielo
folgoreggiando scender, da lâun lato.

VedÃ«a BrÃ¯areo fitto dal telo
celestÃ¯al giacer, da lâaltra parte,
grave a la terra per lo mortal gelo.

Vedea Timbreo, vedea Pallade e Marte,
armati ancora, intorno al padre loro,
mirar le membra dâi Giganti sparte.

Vedea NembrÃ²t a piÃ¨ del gran lavoro
quasi smarrito, e riguardar le genti
che ân SennaÃ r con lui superbi fuoro.

O NÃ¯obÃ¨, con che occhi dolenti
vedea io te segnata in su la strada,
tra sette e sette tuoi figliuoli spenti!

O SaÃ¹l, come in su la propria spada
quivi parevi morto in GelboÃ¨,
che poi non sentÃ¬ pioggia nÃ© rugiada!

O folle Aragne, sÃ¬ vedea io te
giÃ  mezza ragna, trista in su li stracci
de lâopera che mal per te si fÃ©.

O RoboÃ m, giÃ  non par che minacci
quivi âl tuo segno; ma pien di spavento
nel porta un carro, sanza châaltri il cacci.

Mostrava ancor lo duro pavimento
come Almeon a sua madre fÃ© caro
parer lo sventurato addornamento.

Mostrava come i figli si gittaro
sovra SennacherÃ¬b dentro dal tempio,
e come, morto lui, quivi il lasciaro.

Mostrava la ruina e âl crudo scempio
che fÃ© Tamiri, quando disse a Ciro:
Â«Sangue sitisti, e io di sangue tâempioÂ».

Mostrava come in rotta si fuggiro
li Assiri, poi che fu morto Oloferne,
e anche le reliquie del martiro.

Vedeva Troia in cenere e in caverne;
o IlÃ¯Ã³n, come te basso e vile
mostrava il segno che lÃ¬ si discerne!

Qual di pennel fu maestro o di stile
che ritraesse lâombre e â tratti châivi
mirar farieno uno ingegno sottile?

Morti li morti e i vivi parean vivi:
non vide mei di me chi vide il vero,
quantâ io calcai, fin che chinato givi.

Or superbite, e via col viso altero,
figliuoli dâEva, e non chinate il volto
sÃ¬ che veggiate il vostro mal sentero!

PiÃ¹ era giÃ  per noi del monte vÃ²lto
e del cammin del sole assai piÃ¹ speso
che non stimava lâanimo non sciolto,

quando colui che sempre innanzi atteso
andava, cominciÃ²: Â«Drizza la testa;
non Ã¨ piÃ¹ tempo di gir sÃ¬ sospeso.

Vedi colÃ  un angel che sâappresta
per venir verso noi; vedi che torna
dal servigio del dÃ¬ lâancella sesta.

Di reverenza il viso e li atti addorna,
sÃ¬ che i diletti lo ânvÃ¯arci in suso;
pensa che questo dÃ¬ mai non raggiorna!Â».

Io era ben del suo ammonir uso
pur di non perder tempo, sÃ¬ che ân quella
materia non potea parlarmi chiuso.

A noi venÃ¬a la creatura bella,
biancovestito e ne la faccia quale
par tremolando mattutina stella.

Le braccia aperse, e indi aperse lâale;
disse: Â«Venite: qui son presso i gradi,
e agevolemente omai si sale.

A questo invito vegnon molto radi:
o gente umana, per volar sÃ¹ nata,
perchÃ© a poco vento cosÃ¬ cadi?Â».

Menocci ove la roccia era tagliata;
quivi mi battÃ© lâali per la fronte;
poi mi promise sicura lâandata.

Come a man destra, per salire al monte
dove siede la chiesa che soggioga
la ben guidata sopra Rubaconte,

si rompe del montar lâardita foga
per le scalee che si fero ad etade
châera sicuro il quaderno e la doga;

cosÃ¬ sâallenta la ripa che cade
quivi ben ratta da lâaltro girone;
ma quinci e quindi lâalta pietra rade.

Noi volgendo ivi le nostre persone,
âBeati pauperes spiritu!â voci
cantaron sÃ¬, che nol diria sermone.

Ahi quanto son diverse quelle foci
da lâinfernali! chÃ© quivi per canti
sâentra, e lÃ  giÃ¹ per lamenti feroci.

GiÃ  montavam su per li scaglion santi,
ed esser mi parea troppo piÃ¹ lieve
che per lo pian non mi parea davanti.

Ondâ io: Â«Maestro, dÃ¬, qual cosa greve
levata sâÃ¨ da me, che nulla quasi
per me fatica, andando, si riceve?Â».

Rispuose: Â«Quando i P che son rimasi
ancor nel volto tuo presso che stinti,
saranno, comâ Ã¨ lâun, del tutto rasi,

fier li tuoi piÃ¨ dal buon voler sÃ¬ vinti,
che non pur non fatica sentiranno,
ma fia diletto loro esser sÃ¹ pintiÂ».

Allor fecâ io come color che vanno
con cosa in capo non da lor saputa,
se non che â cenni altrui sospecciar fanno;

per che la mano ad accertar sâaiuta,
e cerca e truova e quello officio adempie
che non si puÃ² fornir per la veduta;

e con le dita de la destra scempie
trovai pur sei le lettere che âncise
quel da le chiavi a me sovra le tempie:

a che guardando, il mio duca sorrise.



Purgatorio Â· Canto XIII


Noi eravamo al sommo de la scala,
dove secondamente si risega
lo monte che salendo altrui dismala.

Ivi cosÃ¬ una cornice lega
dintorno il poggio, come la primaia;
se non che lâarco suo piÃ¹ tosto piega.

Ombra non lÃ¬ Ã¨ nÃ© segno che si paia:
parsi la ripa e parsi la via schietta
col livido color de la petraia.

Â«Se qui per dimandar gente sâaspettaÂ»,
ragionava il poeta, Â«io temo forse
che troppo avrÃ  dâindugio nostra elettaÂ».

Poi fisamente al sole li occhi porse;
fece del destro lato a muover centro,
e la sinistra parte di sÃ© torse.

Â«O dolce lume a cui fidanza iâ entro
per lo novo cammin, tu ne conduciÂ»,
dicea, Â«come condur si vuol quincâ entro.

Tu scaldi il mondo, tu sovrâ esso luci;
sâaltra ragione in contrario non ponta,
esser dien sempre li tuoi raggi duciÂ».

Quanto di qua per un migliaio si conta,
tanto di lÃ  eravam noi giÃ  iti,
con poco tempo, per la voglia pronta;

e verso noi volar furon sentiti,
non perÃ² visti, spiriti parlando
a la mensa dâamor cortesi inviti.

La prima voce che passÃ² volando
âVinum non habentâ altamente disse,
e dietro a noi lâandÃ² reÃ¯terando.

E prima che del tutto non si udisse
per allungarsi, unâaltra âIâ sono Oresteâ
passÃ² gridando, e anco non sâaffisse.

Â«Oh!Â», dissâ io, Â«padre, che voci son queste?Â».
E comâ io domandai, ecco la terza
dicendo: âAmate da cui male avesteâ.

E âl buon maestro: Â«Questo cinghio sferza
la colpa de la invidia, e perÃ² sono
tratte dâamor le corde de la ferza.

Lo fren vuol esser del contrario suono;
credo che lâudirai, per mio avviso,
prima che giunghi al passo del perdono.

Ma ficca li occhi per lâaere ben fiso,
e vedrai gente innanzi a noi sedersi,
e ciascun Ã¨ lungo la grotta assisoÂ».

Allora piÃ¹ che prima li occhi apersi;
guardaâmi innanzi, e vidi ombre con manti
al color de la pietra non diversi.

E poi che fummo un poco piÃ¹ avanti,
udia gridar: âMaria, Ã²ra per noiâ:
gridar âMicheleâ e âPietroâ e âTutti santiâ.

Non credo che per terra vada ancoi
omo sÃ¬ duro, che non fosse punto
per compassion di quel châiâ vidi poi;

chÃ©, quando fui sÃ¬ presso di lor giunto,
che li atti loro a me venivan certi,
per li occhi fui di grave dolor munto.

Di vil ciliccio mi parean coperti,
e lâun sofferia lâaltro con la spalla,
e tutti da la ripa eran sofferti.

CosÃ¬ li ciechi a cui la roba falla,
stanno aâ perdoni a chieder lor bisogna,
e lâuno il capo sopra lâaltro avvalla,

perchÃ© ân altrui pietÃ  tosto si pogna,
non pur per lo sonar de le parole,
ma per la vista che non meno agogna.

E come a li orbi non approda il sole,
cosÃ¬ a lâombre quivi, ondâ io parlo ora,
luce del ciel di sÃ© largir non vole;

chÃ© a tutti un fil di ferro i cigli fÃ³ra
e cusce sÃ¬, come a sparvier selvaggio
si fa perÃ² che queto non dimora.

A me pareva, andando, fare oltraggio,
veggendo altrui, non essendo veduto:
per châio mi volsi al mio consiglio saggio.

Ben sapevâ ei che volea dir lo muto;
e perÃ² non attese mia dimanda,
ma disse: Â«Parla, e sie breve e argutoÂ».

Virgilio mi venÃ¬a da quella banda
de la cornice onde cader si puote,
perchÃ© da nulla sponda sâinghirlanda;

da lâaltra parte mâeran le divote
ombre, che per lâorribile costura
premevan sÃ¬, che bagnavan le gote.

Volsimi a loro e: Â«O gente sicuraÂ»,
incominciai, Â«di veder lâalto lume
che âl disio vostro solo ha in sua cura,

se tosto grazia resolva le schiume
di vostra coscÃ¯enza sÃ¬ che chiaro
per essa scenda de la mente il fiume,

ditemi, chÃ© mi fia grazioso e caro,
sâanima Ã¨ qui tra voi che sia latina;
e forse lei sarÃ  buon sâiâ lâapparoÂ».

Â«O frate mio, ciascuna Ã¨ cittadina
dâuna vera cittÃ ; ma tu vuoâ dire
che vivesse in Italia peregrinaÂ».

Questo mi parve per risposta udire
piÃ¹ innanzi alquanto che lÃ  dovâ io stava,
ondâ io mi feci ancor piÃ¹ lÃ  sentire.

Tra lâaltre vidi unâombra châaspettava
in vista; e se volesse alcun dir âCome?â,
lo mento a guisa dâorbo in sÃ¹ levava.

Â«SpirtoÂ», dissâ io, Â«che per salir ti dome,
se tu seâ quelli che mi rispondesti,
fammiti conto o per luogo o per nomeÂ».

Â«Io fui saneseÂ», rispuose, Â«e con questi
altri rimendo qui la vita ria,
lagrimando a colui che sÃ© ne presti.

Savia non fui, avvegna che SapÃ¬a
fossi chiamata, e fui de li altrui danni
piÃ¹ lieta assai che di ventura mia.

E perchÃ© tu non creda châio tâinganni,
odi sâiâ fui, comâ io ti dico, folle,
giÃ  discendendo lâarco dâi miei anni.

Eran li cittadin miei presso a Colle
in campo giunti coâ loro avversari,
e io pregava Iddio di quel châeâ volle.

Rotti fuor quivi e vÃ²lti ne li amari
passi di fuga; e veggendo la caccia,
letizia presi a tutte altre dispari,

tanto châio volsi in sÃ¹ lâardita faccia,
gridando a Dio: âOmai piÃ¹ non ti temo!â,
come fÃ© âl merlo per poca bonaccia.

Pace volli con Dio in su lo stremo
de la mia vita; e ancor non sarebbe
lo mio dover per penitenza scemo,

se ciÃ² non fosse, châa memoria mâebbe
Pier Pettinaio in sue sante orazioni,
a cui di me per caritate increbbe.

Ma tu chi seâ, che nostre condizioni
vai dimandando, e porti li occhi sciolti,
sÃ¬ comâ io credo, e spirando ragioni?Â».

Â«Li occhiÂ», dissâ io, Â«mi fieno ancor qui tolti,
ma picciol tempo, chÃ© poca Ã¨ lâoffesa
fatta per esser con invidia vÃ²lti.

Troppa Ã¨ piÃ¹ la paura ondâ Ã¨ sospesa
lâanima mia del tormento di sotto,
che giÃ  lo âncarco di lÃ  giÃ¹ mi pesaÂ».

Ed ella a me: Â«Chi tâha dunque condotto
qua sÃ¹ tra noi, se giÃ¹ ritornar credi?Â».
E io: Â«Costui châÃ¨ meco e non fa motto.

E vivo sono; e perÃ² mi richiedi,
spirito eletto, se tu vuoâ châiâ mova
di lÃ  per te ancor li mortai piediÂ».

Â«Oh, questa Ã¨ a udir sÃ¬ cosa nuovaÂ»,
rispuose, Â«che gran segno Ã¨ che Dio tâami;
perÃ² col priego tuo talor mi giova.

E cheggioti, per quel che tu piÃ¹ brami,
se mai calchi la terra di Toscana,
che aâ miei propinqui tu ben mi rinfami.

Tu li vedrai tra quella gente vana
che spera in Talamone, e perderagli
piÃ¹ di speranza châa trovar la Diana;

ma piÃ¹ vi perderanno li ammiragliÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto XIV


Â«Chi Ã¨ costui che âl nostro monte cerchia
prima che morte li abbia dato il volo,
e apre li occhi a sua voglia e coverchia?Â».

Â«Non so chi sia, ma so châeâ non Ã¨ solo;
domandal tu che piÃ¹ li tâavvicini,
e dolcemente, sÃ¬ che parli, accoâloÂ».

CosÃ¬ due spirti, lâuno a lâaltro chini,
ragionavan di me ivi a man dritta;
poi fer li visi, per dirmi, supini;

e disse lâuno: Â«O anima che fitta
nel corpo ancora inverâ lo ciel ten vai,
per caritÃ  ne consola e ne ditta

onde vieni e chi seâ; chÃ© tu ne fai
tanto maravigliar de la tua grazia,
quanto vuol cosa che non fu piÃ¹ maiÂ».

E io: Â«Per mezza Toscana si spazia
un fiumicel che nasce in Falterona,
e cento miglia di corso nol sazia.

Di sovrâ esso rechâ io questa persona:
dirvi châiâ sia, saria parlare indarno,
chÃ© âl nome mio ancor molto non suonaÂ».

Â«Se ben lo ântendimento tuo accarno
con lo ântellettoÂ», allora mi rispuose
quei che diceva pria, Â«tu parli dâArnoÂ».

E lâaltro disse lui: Â«PerchÃ© nascose
questi il vocabol di quella riviera,
pur comâ om fa de lâorribili cose?Â».

E lâombra che di ciÃ² domandata era,
si sdebitÃ² cosÃ¬: Â«Non so; ma degno
ben Ã¨ che âl nome di tal valle pÃ¨ra;

chÃ© dal principio suo, ovâ Ã¨ sÃ¬ pregno
lâalpestro monte ondâ Ã¨ tronco Peloro,
che ân pochi luoghi passa oltra quel segno,

infin lÃ  âve si rende per ristoro
di quel che âl ciel de la marina asciuga,
ondâ hanno i fiumi ciÃ² che va con loro,

vertÃ¹ cosÃ¬ per nimica si fuga
da tutti come biscia, o per sventura
del luogo, o per mal uso che li fruga:

ondâ hanno sÃ¬ mutata lor natura
li abitator de la misera valle,
che par che Circe li avesse in pastura.

Tra brutti porci, piÃ¹ degni di galle
che dâaltro cibo fatto in uman uso,
dirizza prima il suo povero calle.

Botoli trova poi, venendo giuso,
ringhiosi piÃ¹ che non chiede lor possa,
e da lor disdegnosa torce il muso.

Vassi caggendo; e quantâ ella piÃ¹ ângrossa,
tanto piÃ¹ trova di can farsi lupi
la maladetta e sventurata fossa.

Discesa poi per piÃ¹ pelaghi cupi,
trova le volpi sÃ¬ piene di froda,
che non temono ingegno che le occÃ¹pi.

NÃ© lascerÃ² di dir perchâ altri mâoda;
e buon sarÃ  costui, sâancor sâammenta
di ciÃ² che vero spirto mi disnoda.

Io veggio tuo nepote che diventa
cacciator di quei lupi in su la riva
del fiero fiume, e tutti li sgomenta.

Vende la carne loro essendo viva;
poscia li ancide come antica belva;
molti di vita e sÃ© di pregio priva.

Sanguinoso esce de la trista selva;
lasciala tal, che di qui a mille anni
ne lo stato primaio non si rinselvaÂ».

Comâ a lâannunzio di dogliosi danni
si turba il viso di colui châascolta,
da qual che parte il periglio lâassanni,

cosÃ¬ vidâ io lâaltrâ anima, che volta
stava a udir, turbarsi e farsi trista,
poi châebbe la parola a sÃ© raccolta.

Lo dir de lâuna e de lâaltra la vista
mi fer voglioso di saper lor nomi,
e dimanda ne fei con prieghi mista;

per che lo spirto che di pria parlÃ²mi
ricominciÃ²: Â«Tu vuoâ châio mi deduca
nel fare a te ciÃ² che tu far non vuoâmi.

Ma da che Dio in te vuol che traluca
tanto sua grazia, non ti sarÃ² scarso;
perÃ² sappi châio fui Guido del Duca.

Fu il sangue mio dâinvidia sÃ¬ rÃ¯arso,
che se veduto avesse uom farsi lieto,
visto mâavresti di livore sparso.

Di mia semente cotal paglia mieto;
o gente umana, perchÃ© poni âl core
lÃ  âvâ Ã¨ mestier di consorte divieto?

Questi Ã¨ Rinier; questi Ã¨ âl pregio e lâonore
de la casa da Calboli, ove nullo
fatto sâÃ¨ reda poi del suo valore.

E non pur lo suo sangue Ã¨ fatto brullo,
tra âl Po e âl monte e la marina e âl Reno,
del ben richesto al vero e al trastullo;

chÃ© dentro a questi termini Ã¨ ripieno
di venenosi sterpi, sÃ¬ che tardi
per coltivare omai verrebber meno.

Ovâ Ã¨ âl buon Lizio e Arrigo Mainardi?
Pier Traversaro e Guido di Carpigna?
Oh Romagnuoli tornati in bastardi!

Quando in Bologna un Fabbro si ralligna?
quando in Faenza un Bernardin di Fosco,
verga gentil di picciola gramigna?

Non ti maravigliar sâio piango, Tosco,
quando rimembro, con Guido da Prata,
Ugolin dâAzzo che vivette nosco,

Federigo Tignoso e sua brigata,
la casa Traversara e li Anastagi
(e lâuna gente e lâaltra Ã¨ diretata),

le donne e â cavalier, li affanni e li agi
che ne ânvogliava amore e cortesia
lÃ  dove i cuor son fatti sÃ¬ malvagi.

O Bretinoro, chÃ© non fuggi via,
poi che gita se nâÃ¨ la tua famiglia
e molta gente per non esser ria?

Ben fa Bagnacaval, che non rifiglia;
e mal fa Castrocaro, e peggio Conio,
che di figliar tai conti piÃ¹ sâimpiglia.

Ben faranno i Pagan, da che âl demonio
lor sen girÃ ; ma non perÃ² che puro
giÃ  mai rimagna dâessi testimonio.

O Ugolin deâ Fantolin, sicuro
Ã¨ âl nome tuo, da che piÃ¹ non sâaspetta
chi far lo possa, tralignando, scuro.

Ma va via, Tosco, omai; châor mi diletta
troppo di pianger piÃ¹ che di parlare,
sÃ¬ mâha nostra ragion la mente strettaÂ».

Noi sapavam che quellâ anime care
ci sentivano andar; perÃ², tacendo,
facÃ«an noi del cammin confidare.

Poi fummo fatti soli procedendo,
folgore parve quando lâaere fende,
voce che giunse di contra dicendo:

âAnciderammi qualunque mâapprendeâ;
e fuggÃ¬ come tuon che si dilegua,
se sÃ¹bito la nuvola scoscende.

Come da lei lâudir nostro ebbe triegua,
ed ecco lâaltra con sÃ¬ gran fracasso,
che somigliÃ² tonar che tosto segua:

Â«Io sono Aglauro che divenni sassoÂ»;
e allor, per ristrignermi al poeta,
in destro feci, e non innanzi, il passo.

GiÃ  era lâaura dâogne parte queta;
ed el mi disse: Â«Quel fu âl duro camo
che dovria lâuom tener dentro a sua meta.

Ma voi prendete lâesca, sÃ¬ che lâamo
de lâantico avversaro a sÃ© vi tira;
e perÃ² poco val freno o richiamo.

Chiamavi âl cielo e ântorno vi si gira,
mostrandovi le sue bellezze etterne,
e lâocchio vostro pur a terra mira;

onde vi batte chi tutto discerneÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto XV


Quanto tra lâultimar de lâora terza
e âl principio del dÃ¬ par de la spera
che sempre a guisa di fanciullo scherza,

tanto pareva giÃ  inverâ la sera
essere al sol del suo corso rimaso;
vespero lÃ , e qui mezza notte era.

E i raggi ne ferien per mezzo âl naso,
perchÃ© per noi girato era sÃ¬ âl monte,
che giÃ  dritti andavamo inverâ lâoccaso,

quandâ io sentiâ a me gravar la fronte
a lo splendore assai piÃ¹ che di prima,
e stupor mâeran le cose non conte;

ondâ io levai le mani inverâ la cima
de le mie ciglia, e fecimi âl solecchio,
che del soverchio visibile lima.

Come quando da lâacqua o da lo specchio
salta lo raggio a lâopposita parte,
salendo su per lo modo parecchio

a quel che scende, e tanto si diparte
dal cader de la pietra in igual tratta,
sÃ¬ come mostra esperÃ¯enza e arte;

cosÃ¬ mi parve da luce rifratta
quivi dinanzi a me esser percosso;
per che a fuggir la mia vista fu ratta.

Â«Che Ã¨ quel, dolce padre, a che non posso
schermar lo viso tanto che mi vagliaÂ»,
dissâ io, Â«e pare inverâ noi esser mosso?Â».

Â«Non ti maravigliar sâancor tâabbaglia
la famiglia del cieloÂ», a me rispuose:
Â«messo Ã¨ che viene ad invitar châom saglia.

Tosto sarÃ  châa veder queste cose
non ti fia grave, ma fieti diletto
quanto natura a sentir ti dispuoseÂ».

Poi giunti fummo a lâangel benedetto,
con lieta voce disse: Â«Intrate quinci
ad un scaleo vie men che li altri erettoÂ».

Noi montavam, giÃ  partiti di linci,
e âBeati misericordes!â fue
cantato retro, e âGodi tu che vinci!â.

Lo mio maestro e io soli amendue
suso andavamo; e io pensai, andando,
prode acquistar ne le parole sue;

e dirizzaâmi a lui sÃ¬ dimandando:
Â«Che volse dir lo spirto di Romagna,
e âdivietoâ e âconsorteâ menzionando?Â».

Per châelli a me: Â«Di sua maggior magagna
conosce il danno; e perÃ² non sâammiri
se ne riprende perchÃ© men si piagna.

PerchÃ© sâappuntano i vostri disiri
dove per compagnia parte si scema,
invidia move il mantaco aâ sospiri.

Ma se lâamor de la spera supprema
torcesse in suso il disiderio vostro,
non vi sarebbe al petto quella tema;

chÃ©, per quanti si dice piÃ¹ lÃ¬ ânostroâ,
tanto possiede piÃ¹ di ben ciascuno,
e piÃ¹ di caritate arde in quel chiostroÂ».

Â«Io son dâesser contento piÃ¹ digiunoÂ»,
dissâ io, Â«che se mi fosse pria taciuto,
e piÃ¹ di dubbio ne la mente aduno.

Comâ esser puote châun ben, distributo
in piÃ¹ posseditor, faccia piÃ¹ ricchi
di sÃ© che se da pochi Ã¨ posseduto?Â».

Ed elli a me: Â«PerÃ² che tu rificchi
la mente pur a le cose terrene,
di vera luce tenebre dispicchi.

Quello infinito e ineffabil bene
che lÃ  sÃ¹ Ã¨, cosÃ¬ corre ad amore
comâ a lucido corpo raggio vene.

Tanto si dÃ  quanto trova dâardore;
sÃ¬ che, quantunque caritÃ  si stende,
cresce sovrâ essa lâetterno valore.

E quanta gente piÃ¹ lÃ  sÃ¹ sâintende,
piÃ¹ vâÃ¨ da bene amare, e piÃ¹ vi sâama,
e come specchio lâuno a lâaltro rende.

E se la mia ragion non ti disfama,
vedrai Beatrice, ed ella pienamente
ti torrÃ  questa e ciascunâ altra brama.

Procaccia pur che tosto sieno spente,
come son giÃ  le due, le cinque piaghe,
che si richiudon per esser dolenteÂ».

Comâ io voleva dicer âTu mâappagheâ,
vidimi giunto in su lâaltro girone,
sÃ¬ che tacer mi fer le luci vaghe.

Ivi mi parve in una visÃ¯one
estatica di sÃ¹bito esser tratto,
e vedere in un tempio piÃ¹ persone;

e una donna, in su lâentrar, con atto
dolce di madre dicer: Â«Figliuol mio,
perchÃ© hai tu cosÃ¬ verso noi fatto?

Ecco, dolenti, lo tuo padre e io
ti cercavamoÂ». E come qui si tacque,
ciÃ² che pareva prima, dispario.

Indi mâapparve unâaltra con quellâ acque
giÃ¹ per le gote che âl dolor distilla
quando di gran dispetto in altrui nacque,

e dir: Â«Se tu seâ sire de la villa
del cui nome neâ dÃ¨i fu tanta lite,
e onde ogne scÃ¯enza disfavilla,

vendica te di quelle braccia ardite
châabbracciar nostra figlia, o PisistrÃ toÂ».
E âl segnor mi parea, benigno e mite,

risponder lei con viso temperato:
Â«Che farem noi a chi mal ne disira,
se quei che ci ama Ã¨ per noi condannato?Â»,

Poi vidi genti accese in foco dâira
con pietre un giovinetto ancider, forte
gridando a sÃ© pur: Â«Martira, martira!Â».

E lui vedea chinarsi, per la morte
che lâaggravava giÃ , inverâ la terra,
ma de li occhi facea sempre al ciel porte,

orando a lâalto Sire, in tanta guerra,
che perdonasse aâ suoi persecutori,
con quello aspetto che pietÃ  diserra.

Quando lâanima mia tornÃ² di fori
a le cose che son fuor di lei vere,
io riconobbi i miei non falsi errori.

Lo duca mio, che mi potea vedere
far sÃ¬ comâ om che dal sonno si slega,
disse: Â«Che hai che non ti puoi tenere,

ma seâ venuto piÃ¹ che mezza lega
velando li occhi e con le gambe avvolte,
a guisa di cui vino o sonno piega?Â».

Â«O dolce padre mio, se tu mâascolte,
io ti dirÃ²Â», dissâ io, Â«ciÃ² che mâapparve
quando le gambe mi furon sÃ¬ tolteÂ».

Ed ei: Â«Se tu avessi cento larve
sovra la faccia, non mi sarian chiuse
le tue cogitazion, quantunque parve.

CiÃ² che vedesti fu perchÃ© non scuse
dâaprir lo core a lâacque de la pace
che da lâetterno fonte son diffuse.

Non dimandai âChe hai?â per quel che face
chi guarda pur con lâocchio che non vede,
quando disanimato il corpo giace;

ma dimandai per darti forza al piede:
cosÃ¬ frugar conviensi i pigri, lenti
ad usar lor vigilia quando riedeÂ».

Noi andavam per lo vespero, attenti
oltre quanto potean li occhi allungarsi
contra i raggi serotini e lucenti.

Ed ecco a poco a poco un fummo farsi
verso di noi come la notte oscuro;
nÃ© da quello era loco da cansarsi.

Questo ne tolse li occhi e lâaere puro.



Purgatorio Â· Canto XVI


Buio dâinferno e di notte privata
dâogne pianeto, sotto pover cielo,
quantâ esser puÃ² di nuvol tenebrata,

non fece al viso mio sÃ¬ grosso velo
come quel fummo châivi ci coperse,
nÃ© a sentir di cosÃ¬ aspro pelo,

che lâocchio stare aperto non sofferse;
onde la scorta mia saputa e fida
mi sâaccostÃ² e lâomero mâofferse.

SÃ¬ come cieco va dietro a sua guida
per non smarrirsi e per non dar di cozzo
in cosa che âl molesti, o forse ancida,

mâandava io per lâaere amaro e sozzo,
ascoltando il mio duca che diceva
pur: Â«Guarda che da me tu non sia mozzoÂ».

Io sentia voci, e ciascuna pareva
pregar per pace e per misericordia
lâAgnel di Dio che le peccata leva.

Pur âAgnus Deiâ eran le loro essordia;
una parola in tutte era e un modo,
sÃ¬ che parea tra esse ogne concordia.

Â«Quei sono spirti, maestro, châiâ odo?Â»,
dissâ io. Ed elli a me: Â«Tu vero apprendi,
e dâiracundia van solvendo il nodoÂ».

Â«Or tu chi seâ che âl nostro fummo fendi,
e di noi parli pur come se tue
partissi ancor lo tempo per calendi?Â».

CosÃ¬ per una voce detto fue;
onde âl maestro mio disse: Â«Rispondi,
e domanda se quinci si va sÃ¹eÂ».

E io: Â«O creatura che ti mondi
per tornar bella a colui che ti fece,
maraviglia udirai, se mi secondiÂ».

Â«Io ti seguiterÃ² quanto mi leceÂ»,
rispuose; Â«e se veder fummo non lascia,
lâudir ci terrÃ  giunti in quella veceÂ».

Allora incominciai: Â«Con quella fascia
che la morte dissolve men vo suso,
e venni qui per lâinfernale ambascia.

E se Dio mâha in sua grazia rinchiuso,
tanto che vuol châiâ veggia la sua corte
per modo tutto fuor del moderno uso,

non mi celar chi fosti anzi la morte,
ma dilmi, e dimmi sâiâ vo bene al varco;
e tue parole fier le nostre scorteÂ».

Â«Lombardo fui, e fuâ chiamato Marco;
del mondo seppi, e quel valore amai
al quale ha or ciascun disteso lâarco.

Per montar sÃ¹ dirittamente vaiÂ».
CosÃ¬ rispuose, e soggiunse: Â«Iâ ti prego
che per me prieghi quando sÃ¹ saraiÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Per fede mi ti lego
di far ciÃ² che mi chiedi; ma io scoppio
dentro ad un dubbio, sâio non me ne spiego.

Prima era scempio, e ora Ã¨ fatto doppio
ne la sentenza tua, che mi fa certo
qui, e altrove, quello ovâ io lâaccoppio.

Lo mondo Ã¨ ben cosÃ¬ tutto diserto
dâogne virtute, come tu mi sone,
e di malizia gravido e coverto;

ma priego che mâaddite la cagione,
sÃ¬ châiâ la veggia e châiâ la mostri altrui;
chÃ© nel cielo uno, e un qua giÃ¹ la poneÂ».

Alto sospir, che duolo strinse in Â«uhi!Â»,
mise fuor prima; e poi cominciÃ²: Â«Frate,
lo mondo Ã¨ cieco, e tu vien ben da lui.

Voi che vivete ogne cagion recate
pur suso al cielo, pur come se tutto
movesse seco di necessitate.

Se cosÃ¬ fosse, in voi fora distrutto
libero arbitrio, e non fora giustizia
per ben letizia, e per male aver lutto.

Lo cielo i vostri movimenti inizia;
non dico tutti, ma, posto châiâ âl dica,
lume vâÃ¨ dato a bene e a malizia,

e libero voler; che, se fatica
ne le prime battaglie col ciel dura,
poi vince tutto, se ben si notrica.

A maggior forza e a miglior natura
liberi soggiacete; e quella cria
la mente in voi, che âl ciel non ha in sua cura.

PerÃ², se âl mondo presente disvia,
in voi Ã¨ la cagione, in voi si cheggia;
e io te ne sarÃ² or vera spia.

Esce di mano a lui che la vagheggia
prima che sia, a guisa di fanciulla
che piangendo e ridendo pargoleggia,

lâanima semplicetta che sa nulla,
salvo che, mossa da lieto fattore,
volontier torna a ciÃ² che la trastulla.

Di picciol bene in pria sente sapore;
quivi sâinganna, e dietro ad esso corre,
se guida o fren non torce suo amore.

Onde convenne legge per fren porre;
convenne rege aver, che discernesse
de la vera cittade almen la torre.

Le leggi son, ma chi pon mano ad esse?
Nullo, perÃ² che âl pastor che procede,
rugumar puÃ², ma non ha lâunghie fesse;

per che la gente, che sua guida vede
pur a quel ben fedire ondâ ella Ã¨ ghiotta,
di quel si pasce, e piÃ¹ oltre non chiede.

Ben puoi veder che la mala condotta
Ã¨ la cagion che âl mondo ha fatto reo,
e non natura che ân voi sia corrotta.

Soleva Roma, che âl buon mondo feo,
due soli aver, che lâuna e lâaltra strada
facean vedere, e del mondo e di Deo.

Lâun lâaltro ha spento; ed Ã¨ giunta la spada
col pasturale, e lâun con lâaltro insieme
per viva forza mal convien che vada;

perÃ² che, giunti, lâun lâaltro non teme:
se non mi credi, pon mente a la spiga,
châognâ erba si conosce per lo seme.

In sul paese châAdice e Po riga,
solea valore e cortesia trovarsi,
prima che Federigo avesse briga;

or puÃ² sicuramente indi passarsi
per qualunque lasciasse, per vergogna
di ragionar coi buoni o dâappressarsi.

Ben vâÃ¨n tre vecchi ancora in cui rampogna
lâantica etÃ  la nova, e par lor tardo
che Dio a miglior vita li ripogna:

Currado da Palazzo e âl buon Gherardo
e Guido da Castel, che mei si noma,
francescamente, il semplice Lombardo.

DÃ¬ oggimai che la Chiesa di Roma,
per confondere in sÃ© due reggimenti,
cade nel fango, e sÃ© brutta e la somaÂ».

Â«O Marco mioÂ», dissâ io, Â«bene argomenti;
e or discerno perchÃ© dal retaggio
li figli di LevÃ¬ furono essenti.

Ma qual Gherardo Ã¨ quel che tu per saggio
diâ châÃ¨ rimaso de la gente spenta,
in rimprovÃ¨ro del secol selvaggio?Â».

Â«O tuo parlar mâinganna, o el mi tentaÂ»,
rispuose a me; Â«chÃ©, parlandomi tosco,
par che del buon Gherardo nulla senta.

Per altro sopranome io nol conosco,
sâio nol togliessi da sua figlia Gaia.
Dio sia con voi, chÃ© piÃ¹ non vegno vosco.

Vedi lâalbor che per lo fummo raia
giÃ  biancheggiare, e me convien partirmi
(lâangelo Ã¨ ivi) prima châio li paiaÂ».

CosÃ¬ tornÃ², e piÃ¹ non volle udirmi.



Purgatorio Â· Canto XVII


Ricorditi, lettor, se mai ne lâalpe
ti colse nebbia per la qual vedessi
non altrimenti che per pelle talpe,

come, quando i vapori umidi e spessi
a diradar cominciansi, la spera
del sol debilemente entra per essi;

e fia la tua imagine leggera
in giugnere a veder comâ io rividi
lo sole in pria, che giÃ  nel corcar era.

SÃ¬, pareggiando i miei coâ passi fidi
del mio maestro, usciâ fuor di tal nube
ai raggi morti giÃ  neâ bassi lidi.

O imaginativa che ne rube
talvolta sÃ¬ di fuor, châom non sâaccorge
perchÃ© dintorno suonin mille tube,

chi move te, se âl senso non ti porge?
Moveti lume che nel ciel sâinforma,
per sÃ© o per voler che giÃ¹ lo scorge.

De lâempiezza di lei che mutÃ² forma
ne lâuccel châa cantar piÃ¹ si diletta,
ne lâimagine mia apparve lâorma;

e qui fu la mia mente sÃ¬ ristretta
dentro da sÃ©, che di fuor non venÃ¬a
cosa che fosse allor da lei ricetta.

Poi piovve dentro a lâalta fantasia
un crucifisso, dispettoso e fero
ne la sua vista, e cotal si moria;

intorno ad esso era il grande AssÃ¼ero,
EstÃ¨r sua sposa e âl giusto Mardoceo,
che fu al dire e al far cosÃ¬ intero.

E come questa imagine rompeo
sÃ© per sÃ© stessa, a guisa dâuna bulla
cui manca lâacqua sotto qual si feo,

surse in mia visÃ¯one una fanciulla
piangendo forte, e dicea: Â«O regina,
perchÃ© per ira hai voluto esser nulla?

Ancisa tâhai per non perder Lavina;
or mâhai perduta! Io son essa che lutto,
madre, a la tua pria châa lâaltrui ruinaÂ».

Come si frange il sonno ove di butto
nova luce percuote il viso chiuso,
che fratto guizza pria che muoia tutto;

cosÃ¬ lâimaginar mio cadde giuso
tosto che lume il volto mi percosse,
maggior assai che quel châÃ¨ in nostro uso.

Iâ mi volgea per veder ovâ io fosse,
quando una voce disse Â«Qui si montaÂ»,
che da ogne altro intento mi rimosse;

e fece la mia voglia tanto pronta
di riguardar chi era che parlava,
che mai non posa, se non si raffronta.

Ma come al sol che nostra vista grava
e per soverchio sua figura vela,
cosÃ¬ la mia virtÃ¹ quivi mancava.

Â«Questo Ã¨ divino spirito, che ne la
via da ir sÃ¹ ne drizza sanza prego,
e col suo lume sÃ© medesmo cela.

SÃ¬ fa con noi, come lâuom si fa sego;
chÃ© quale aspetta prego e lâuopo vede,
malignamente giÃ  si mette al nego.

Or accordiamo a tanto invito il piede;
procacciam di salir pria che sâabbui,
chÃ© poi non si poria, se âl dÃ¬ non riedeÂ».

CosÃ¬ disse il mio duca, e io con lui
volgemmo i nostri passi ad una scala;
e tosto châio al primo grado fui,

sentiâmi presso quasi un muover dâala
e ventarmi nel viso e dir: âBeati
pacifici, che son sanzâ ira mala!â.

GiÃ  eran sovra noi tanto levati
li ultimi raggi che la notte segue,
che le stelle apparivan da piÃ¹ lati.

âO virtÃ¹ mia, perchÃ© sÃ¬ ti dilegue?â,
fra me stesso dicea, chÃ© mi sentiva
la possa de le gambe posta in triegue.

Noi eravam dove piÃ¹ non saliva
la scala sÃ¹, ed eravamo affissi,
pur come nave châa la piaggia arriva.

E io attesi un poco, sâio udissi
alcuna cosa nel novo girone;
poi mi volsi al maestro mio, e dissi:

Â«Dolce mio padre, dÃ¬, quale offensione
si purga qui nel giro dove semo?
Se i piÃ¨ si stanno, non stea tuo sermoneÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«Lâamor del bene, scemo
del suo dover, quiritta si ristora;
qui si ribatte il mal tardato remo.

Ma perchÃ© piÃ¹ aperto intendi ancora,
volgi la mente a me, e prenderai
alcun buon frutto di nostra dimoraÂ».

Â«NÃ© creator nÃ© creatura maiÂ»,
cominciÃ² el, Â«figliuol, fu sanza amore,
o naturale o dâanimo; e tu âl sai.

Lo naturale Ã¨ sempre sanza errore,
ma lâaltro puote errar per malo obietto
o per troppo o per poco di vigore.

Mentre châelli Ã¨ nel primo ben diretto,
e neâ secondi sÃ© stesso misura,
esser non puÃ² cagion di mal diletto;

ma quando al mal si torce, o con piÃ¹ cura
o con men che non dee corre nel bene,
contra âl fattore adovra sua fattura.

Quinci comprender puoi châesser convene
amor sementa in voi dâogne virtute
e dâogne operazion che merta pene.

Or, perchÃ© mai non puÃ² da la salute
amor del suo subietto volger viso,
da lâodio proprio son le cose tute;

e perchÃ© intender non si puÃ² diviso,
e per sÃ© stante, alcuno esser dal primo,
da quello odiare ogne effetto Ã¨ deciso.

Resta, se dividendo bene stimo,
che âl mal che sâama Ã¨ del prossimo; ed esso
amor nasce in tre modi in vostro limo.

Ã chi, per esser suo vicin soppresso,
spera eccellenza, e sol per questo brama
châel sia di sua grandezza in basso messo;

Ã¨ chi podere, grazia, onore e fama
teme di perder perchâ altri sormonti,
onde sâattrista sÃ¬ che âl contrario ama;

ed Ã¨ chi per ingiuria par châaonti,
sÃ¬ che si fa de la vendetta ghiotto,
e tal convien che âl male altrui impronti.

Questo triforme amor qua giÃ¹ di sotto
si piange: or voâ che tu de lâaltro intende,
che corre al ben con ordine corrotto.

Ciascun confusamente un bene apprende
nel qual si queti lâanimo, e disira;
per che di giugner lui ciascun contende.

Se lento amore a lui veder vi tira
o a lui acquistar, questa cornice,
dopo giusto penter, ve ne martira.

Altro ben Ã¨ che non fa lâuom felice;
non Ã¨ felicitÃ , non Ã¨ la buona
essenza, dâogne ben frutto e radice.

Lâamor châad esso troppo sâabbandona,
di sovrâ a noi si piange per tre cerchi;
ma come tripartito si ragiona,

tacciolo, acciÃ² che tu per te ne cerchiÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto XVIII


Posto avea fine al suo ragionamento
lâalto dottore, e attento guardava
ne la mia vista sâio parea contento;

e io, cui nova sete ancor frugava,
di fuor tacea, e dentro dicea: âForse
lo troppo dimandar châio fo li gravaâ.

Ma quel padre verace, che sâaccorse
del timido voler che non sâapriva,
parlando, di parlare ardir mi porse.

Ondâ io: Â«Maestro, il mio veder sâavviva
sÃ¬ nel tuo lume, châio discerno chiaro
quanto la tua ragion parta o descriva.

PerÃ² ti prego, dolce padre caro,
che mi dimostri amore, a cui reduci
ogne buono operare e âl suo contraroÂ».

Â«DrizzaÂ», disse, Â«verâ me lâagute luci
de lo ântelletto, e fieti manifesto
lâerror deâ ciechi che si fanno duci.

Lâanimo, châÃ¨ creato ad amar presto,
ad ogne cosa Ã¨ mobile che piace,
tosto che dal piacere in atto Ã¨ desto.

Vostra apprensiva da esser verace
tragge intenzione, e dentro a voi la spiega,
sÃ¬ che lâanimo ad essa volger face;

e se, rivolto, inverâ di lei si piega,
quel piegare Ã¨ amor, quellâ Ã¨ natura
che per piacer di novo in voi si lega.

Poi, come âl foco movesi in altura
per la sua forma châÃ¨ nata a salire
lÃ  dove piÃ¹ in sua matera dura,

cosÃ¬ lâanimo preso entra in disire,
châÃ¨ moto spiritale, e mai non posa
fin che la cosa amata il fa gioire.

Or ti puote apparer quantâ Ã¨ nascosa
la veritate a la gente châavvera
ciascun amore in sÃ© laudabil cosa;

perÃ² che forse appar la sua matera
sempre esser buona, ma non ciascun segno
Ã¨ buono, ancor che buona sia la ceraÂ».

Â«Le tue parole e âl mio seguace ingegnoÂ»,
rispuosâ io lui, Â«mâhanno amor discoverto,
ma ciÃ² mâha fatto di dubbiar piÃ¹ pregno;

chÃ©, sâamore Ã¨ di fuori a noi offerto
e lâanima non va con altro piede,
se dritta o torta va, non Ã¨ suo mertoÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«Quanto ragion qui vede,
dir ti possâ io; da indi in lÃ  tâaspetta
pur a Beatrice, châÃ¨ opra di fede.

Ogne forma sustanzÃ¯al, che setta
Ã¨ da matera ed Ã¨ con lei unita,
specifica vertute ha in sÃ© colletta,

la qual sanza operar non Ã¨ sentita,
nÃ© si dimostra mai che per effetto,
come per verdi fronde in pianta vita.

PerÃ², lÃ  onde vegna lo ântelletto
de le prime notizie, omo non sape,
e deâ primi appetibili lâaffetto,

che sono in voi sÃ¬ come studio in ape
di far lo mele; e questa prima voglia
merto di lode o di biasmo non cape.

Or perchÃ© a questa ognâ altra si raccoglia,
innata vâÃ¨ la virtÃ¹ che consiglia,
e de lâassenso deâ tener la soglia.

Questâ Ã¨ âl principio lÃ  onde si piglia
ragion di meritare in voi, secondo
che buoni e rei amori accoglie e viglia.

Color che ragionando andaro al fondo,
sâaccorser dâesta innata libertate;
perÃ² moralitÃ  lasciaro al mondo.

Onde, poniam che di necessitate
surga ogne amor che dentro a voi sâaccende,
di ritenerlo Ã¨ in voi la podestate.

La nobile virtÃ¹ Beatrice intende
per lo libero arbitrio, e perÃ² guarda
che lâabbi a mente, sâa parlar ten prendeÂ».

La luna, quasi a mezza notte tarda,
facea le stelle a noi parer piÃ¹ rade,
fatta comâ un secchion che tuttor arda;

e correa contro âl ciel per quelle strade
che âl sole infiamma allor che quel da Roma
tra â Sardi e â Corsi il vede quando cade.

E quellâ ombra gentil per cui si noma
Pietola piÃ¹ che villa mantoana,
del mio carcar diposta avea la soma;

per châio, che la ragione aperta e piana
sovra le mie quistioni avea ricolta,
stava comâ om che sonnolento vana.

Ma questa sonnolenza mi fu tolta
subitamente da gente che dopo
le nostre spalle a noi era giÃ  volta.

E quale Ismeno giÃ  vide e Asopo
lungo di sÃ¨ di notte furia e calca,
pur che i Teban di Bacco avesser uopo,

cotal per quel giron suo passo falca,
per quel châio vidi di color, venendo,
cui buon volere e giusto amor cavalca.

Tosto fur sovrâ a noi, perchÃ© correndo
si movea tutta quella turba magna;
e due dinanzi gridavan piangendo:

Â«Maria corse con fretta a la montagna;
e Cesare, per soggiogare Ilerda,
punse Marsilia e poi corse in IspagnaÂ».

Â«Ratto, ratto, che âl tempo non si perda
per poco amorÂ», gridavan li altri appresso,
Â«che studio di ben far grazia rinverdaÂ».

Â«O gente in cui fervore aguto adesso
ricompie forse negligenza e indugio
da voi per tepidezza in ben far messo,

questi che vive, e certo iâ non vi bugio,
vuole andar sÃ¹, pur che âl sol ne riluca;
perÃ² ne dite ondâ Ã¨ presso il pertugioÂ».

Parole furon queste del mio duca;
e un di quelli spirti disse: Â«Vieni
di retro a noi, e troverai la buca.

Noi siam di voglia a muoverci sÃ¬ pieni,
che restar non potem; perÃ² perdona,
se villania nostra giustizia tieni.

Io fui abate in San Zeno a Verona
sotto lo âmperio del buon Barbarossa,
di cui dolente ancor Milan ragiona.

E tale ha giÃ  lâun piÃ¨ dentro la fossa,
che tosto piangerÃ  quel monastero,
e tristo fia dâavere avuta possa;

perchÃ© suo figlio, mal del corpo intero,
e de la mente peggio, e che mal nacque,
ha posto in loco di suo pastor veroÂ».

Io non so se piÃ¹ disse o sâei si tacque,
tantâ era giÃ  di lÃ  da noi trascorso;
ma questo intesi, e ritener mi piacque.

E quei che mâera ad ogne uopo soccorso
disse: Â«Volgiti qua: vedine due
venir dando a lâaccidÃ¯a di morsoÂ».

Di retro a tutti dicean: Â«Prima fue
morta la gente a cui il mar sâaperse,
che vedesse Iordan le rede sue.

E quella che lâaffanno non sofferse
fino a la fine col figlio dâAnchise,
sÃ© stessa a vita sanza gloria offerseÂ».

Poi quando fuor da noi tanto divise
quellâ ombre, che veder piÃ¹ non potiersi,
novo pensiero dentro a me si mise,

del qual piÃ¹ altri nacquero e diversi;
e tanto dâuno in altro vaneggiai,
che li occhi per vaghezza ricopersi,

e âl pensamento in sogno trasmutai.



Purgatorio Â· Canto XIX


Ne lâora che non puÃ² âl calor dÃ¯urno
intepidar piÃ¹ âl freddo de la luna,
vinto da terra, e talor da Saturno

âquando i geomanti lor Maggior Fortuna
veggiono in orÃ¯ente, innanzi a lâalba,
surger per via che poco le sta brunaâ,

mi venne in sogno una femmina balba,
ne li occhi guercia, e sovra i piÃ¨ distorta,
con le man monche, e di colore scialba.

Io la mirava; e come âl sol conforta
le fredde membra che la notte aggrava,
cosÃ¬ lo sguardo mio le facea scorta

la lingua, e poscia tutta la drizzava
in poco dâora, e lo smarrito volto,
comâ amor vuol, cosÃ¬ le colorava.

Poi châellâ avea âl parlar cosÃ¬ disciolto,
cominciava a cantar sÃ¬, che con pena
da lei avrei mio intento rivolto.

Â«Io sonÂ», cantava, Â«io son dolce serena,
che â marinari in mezzo mar dismago;
tanto son di piacere a sentir piena!

Io volsi Ulisse del suo cammin vago
al canto mio; e qual meco sâausa,
rado sen parte; sÃ¬ tutto lâappago!Â».

Ancor non era sua bocca richiusa,
quandâ una donna apparve santa e presta
lunghesso me per far colei confusa.

Â«O Virgilio, Virgilio, chi Ã¨ questa?Â»,
fieramente dicea; ed el venÃ¬a
con li occhi fitti pur in quella onesta.

Lâaltra prendea, e dinanzi lâapria
fendendo i drappi, e mostravami âl ventre;
quel mi svegliÃ² col puzzo che nâuscia.

Io mossi li occhi, e âl buon maestro: Â«Almen tre
voci tâho messe!Â», dicea, Â«Surgi e vieni;
troviam lâaperta per la qual tu entreÂ».

SÃ¹ mi levai, e tutti eran giÃ  pieni
de lâalto dÃ¬ i giron del sacro monte,
e andavam col sol novo a le reni.

Seguendo lui, portava la mia fronte
come colui che lâha di pensier carca,
che fa di sÃ© un mezzo arco di ponte;

quandâ io udiâ Â«Venite; qui si varcaÂ»
parlare in modo soave e benigno,
qual non si sente in questa mortal marca.

Con lâali aperte, che parean di cigno,
volseci in sÃ¹ colui che sÃ¬ parlonne
tra due pareti del duro macigno.

Mosse le penne poi e ventilonne,
âQui lugentâ affermando esser beati,
châavran di consolar lâanime donne.

Â«Che hai che pur inverâ la terra guati?Â»,
la guida mia incominciÃ² a dirmi,
poco amendue da lâangel sormontati.

E io: Â«Con tanta sospeccion fa irmi
novella visÃ¯on châa sÃ© mi piega,
sÃ¬ châio non posso dal pensar partirmiÂ».

Â«VedestiÂ», disse, Â«quellâantica strega
che sola sovrâ a noi omai si piagne;
vedesti come lâuom da lei si slega.

Bastiti, e batti a terra le calcagne;
li occhi rivolgi al logoro che gira
lo rege etterno con le rote magneÂ».

Quale âl falcon, che prima aâ piÃ© si mira,
indi si volge al grido e si protende
per lo disio del pasto che lÃ  il tira,

tal mi fecâ io; e tal, quanto si fende
la roccia per dar via a chi va suso,
nâandai infin dove âl cerchiar si prende.

Comâ io nel quinto giro fui dischiuso,
vidi gente per esso che piangea,
giacendo a terra tutta volta in giuso.

âAdhaesit pavimento anima meaâ
sentia dir lor con sÃ¬ alti sospiri,
che la parola a pena sâintendea.

Â«O eletti di Dio, li cui soffriri
e giustizia e speranza fa men duri,
drizzate noi verso li alti saliriÂ».

Â«Se voi venite dal giacer sicuri,
e volete trovar la via piÃ¹ tosto,
le vostre destre sien sempre di foriÂ».

CosÃ¬ pregÃ² âl poeta, e sÃ¬ risposto
poco dinanzi a noi ne fu; per châio
nel parlare avvisai lâaltro nascosto,

e volsi li occhi a li occhi al segnor mio:
ondâ elli mâassentÃ¬ con lieto cenno
ciÃ² che chiedea la vista del disio.

Poi châio potei di me fare a mio senno,
trassimi sovra quella creatura
le cui parole pria notar mi fenno,

dicendo: Â«Spirto in cui pianger matura
quel sanza âl quale a Dio tornar non pÃ²ssi,
sosta un poco per me tua maggior cura.

Chi fosti e perchÃ© vÃ²lti avete i dossi
al sÃ¹, mi dÃ¬, e se vuoâ châio tâimpetri
cosa di lÃ  ondâ io vivendo mossiÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«PerchÃ© i nostri diretri
rivolga il cielo a sÃ©, saprai; ma prima
scias quod ego fui successor Petri.

Intra SÃ¯estri e Chiaveri sâadima
una fiumana bella, e del suo nome
lo titol del mio sangue fa sua cima.

Un mese e poco piÃ¹ provaâ io come
pesa il gran manto a chi dal fango il guarda,
che piuma sembran tutte lâaltre some.

La mia conversÃ¯one, omÃ¨!, fu tarda;
ma, come fatto fui roman pastore,
cosÃ¬ scopersi la vita bugiarda.

Vidi che lÃ¬ non sâacquetava il core,
nÃ© piÃ¹ salir potiesi in quella vita;
per che di questa in me sâaccese amore.

Fino a quel punto misera e partita
da Dio anima fui, del tutto avara;
or, come vedi, qui ne son punita.

Quel châavarizia fa, qui si dichiara
in purgazion de lâanime converse;
e nulla pena il monte ha piÃ¹ amara.

SÃ¬ come lâocchio nostro non sâaderse
in alto, fisso a le cose terrene,
cosÃ¬ giustizia qui a terra il merse.

Come avarizia spense a ciascun bene
lo nostro amore, onde operar perdÃ©si,
cosÃ¬ giustizia qui stretti ne tene,

neâ piedi e ne le man legati e presi;
e quanto fia piacer del giusto Sire,
tanto staremo immobili e distesiÂ».

Io mâera inginocchiato e volea dire;
ma comâ io cominciai ed el sâaccorse,
solo ascoltando, del mio reverire,

Â«Qual cagionÂ», disse, Â«in giÃ¹ cosÃ¬ ti torse?Â».
E io a lui: Â«Per vostra dignitate
mia coscÃ¯enza dritto mi rimorseÂ».

Â«Drizza le gambe, lÃ¨vati sÃ¹, frate!Â»,
rispuose; Â«non errar: conservo sono
teco e con li altri ad una podestate.

Se mai quel santo evangelico suono
che dice âNeque nubentâ intendesti,
ben puoi veder perchâ io cosÃ¬ ragiono.

Vattene omai: non voâ che piÃ¹ tâarresti;
chÃ© la tua stanza mio pianger disagia,
col qual maturo ciÃ² che tu dicesti.

Nepote ho io di lÃ  câha nome Alagia,
buona da sÃ©, pur che la nostra casa
non faccia lei per essempro malvagia;

e questa sola di lÃ  mâÃ¨ rimasaÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto XX


Contra miglior voler voler mal pugna;
onde contra âl piacer mio, per piacerli,
trassi de lâacqua non sazia la spugna.

Mossimi; e âl duca mio si mosse per li
luoghi spediti pur lungo la roccia,
come si va per muro stretto aâ merli;

chÃ© la gente che fonde a goccia a goccia
per li occhi il mal che tutto âl mondo occupa,
da lâaltra parte in fuor troppo sâapproccia.

Maladetta sie tu, antica lupa,
che piÃ¹ che tutte lâaltre bestie hai preda
per la tua fame sanza fine cupa!

O ciel, nel cui girar par che si creda
le condizion di qua giÃ¹ trasmutarsi,
quando verrÃ  per cui questa disceda?

Noi andavam con passi lenti e scarsi,
e io attento a lâombre, châiâ sentia
pietosamente piangere e lagnarsi;

e per ventura udiâ Â«Dolce Maria!Â»
dinanzi a noi chiamar cosÃ¬ nel pianto
come fa donna che in parturir sia;

e seguitar: Â«Povera fosti tanto,
quanto veder si puÃ² per quello ospizio
dove sponesti il tuo portato santoÂ».

Seguentemente intesi: Â«O buon Fabrizio,
con povertÃ  volesti anzi virtute
che gran ricchezza posseder con vizioÂ».

Queste parole mâeran sÃ¬ piaciute,
châio mi trassi oltre per aver contezza
di quello spirto onde parean venute.

Esso parlava ancor de la larghezza
che fece NiccolÃ² a le pulcelle,
per condurre ad onor lor giovinezza.

Â«O anima che tanto ben favelle,
dimmi chi fostiÂ», dissi, Â«e perchÃ© sola
tu queste degne lode rinovelle.

Non fia sanza mercÃ© la tua parola,
sâio ritorno a compiÃ©r lo cammin corto
di quella vita châal termine volaÂ».

Ed elli: Â«Io ti dirÃ², non per conforto
châio attenda di lÃ , ma perchÃ© tanta
grazia in te luce prima che sie morto.

Io fui radice de la mala pianta
che la terra cristiana tutta aduggia,
sÃ¬ che buon frutto rado se ne schianta.

Ma se Doagio, Lilla, Guanto e Bruggia
potesser, tosto ne saria vendetta;
e io la cheggio a lui che tutto giuggia.

Chiamato fui di lÃ  Ugo Ciappetta;
di me son nati i Filippi e i Luigi
per cui novellamente Ã¨ Francia retta.

Figliuol fuâ io dâun beccaio di Parigi:
quando li regi antichi venner meno
tutti, fuor châun renduto in panni bigi,

trovaâmi stretto ne le mani il freno
del governo del regno, e tanta possa
di nuovo acquisto, e sÃ¬ dâamici pieno,

châa la corona vedova promossa
la testa di mio figlio fu, dal quale
cominciar di costor le sacrate ossa.

Mentre che la gran dota provenzale
al sangue mio non tolse la vergogna,
poco valea, ma pur non facea male.

LÃ¬ cominciÃ² con forza e con menzogna
la sua rapina; e poscia, per ammenda,
PontÃ¬ e Normandia prese e Guascogna.

Carlo venne in Italia e, per ammenda,
vittima fÃ© di Curradino; e poi
ripinse al ciel Tommaso, per ammenda.

Tempo veggâ io, non molto dopo ancoi,
che tragge un altro Carlo fuor di Francia,
per far conoscer meglio e sÃ© e â suoi.

Sanzâ arme nâesce e solo con la lancia
con la qual giostrÃ² Giuda, e quella ponta
sÃ¬, châa Fiorenza fa scoppiar la pancia.

Quindi non terra, ma peccato e onta
guadagnerÃ , per sÃ© tanto piÃ¹ grave,
quanto piÃ¹ lieve simil danno conta.

Lâaltro, che giÃ  uscÃ¬ preso di nave,
veggio vender sua figlia e patteggiarne
come fanno i corsar de lâaltre schiave.

O avarizia, che puoi tu piÃ¹ farne,
poscia câhaâ il mio sangue a te sÃ¬ tratto,
che non si cura de la propria carne?

PerchÃ© men paia il mal futuro e âl fatto,
veggio in Alagna intrar lo fiordaliso,
e nel vicario suo Cristo esser catto.

Veggiolo unâaltra volta esser deriso;
veggio rinovellar lâaceto e âl fiele,
e tra vivi ladroni esser anciso.

Veggio il novo Pilato sÃ¬ crudele,
che ciÃ² nol sazia, ma sanza decreto
portar nel Tempio le cupide vele.

O Segnor mio, quando sarÃ² io lieto
a veder la vendetta che, nascosa,
fa dolce lâira tua nel tuo secreto?

CiÃ² châio dicea di quellâ unica sposa
de lo Spirito Santo e che ti fece
verso me volger per alcuna chiosa,

tanto Ã¨ risposto a tutte nostre prece
quanto âl dÃ¬ dura; ma comâ el sâannotta,
contrario suon prendemo in quella vece.

Noi repetiam PigmalÃ¯on allotta,
cui traditore e ladro e paricida
fece la voglia sua de lâoro ghiotta;

e la miseria de lâavaro Mida,
che seguÃ¬ a la sua dimanda gorda,
per la qual sempre convien che si rida.

Del folle AcÃ n ciascun poi si ricorda,
come furÃ² le spoglie, sÃ¬ che lâira
di IosÃ¼Ã¨ qui par châancor lo morda.

Indi accusiam col marito Saffira;
lodiam i calci châebbe ElÃ¯odoro;
e in infamia tutto âl monte gira

PolinestÃ²r châancise Polidoro;
ultimamente ci si grida: âCrasso,
dilci, che âl sai: di che sapore Ã¨ lâoro?â.

Talor parla lâuno alto e lâaltro basso,
secondo lâaffezion châad ir ci sprona
ora a maggiore e ora a minor passo:

perÃ² al ben che âl dÃ¬ ci si ragiona,
dianzi non era io sol; ma qui da presso
non alzava la voce altra personaÂ».

Noi eravam partiti giÃ  da esso,
e brigavam di soverchiar la strada
tanto quanto al poder nâera permesso,

quandâ io sentiâ, come cosa che cada,
tremar lo monte; onde mi prese un gelo
qual prender suol colui châa morte vada.

Certo non si scoteo sÃ¬ forte Delo,
pria che Latona in lei facesse âl nido
a parturir li due occhi del cielo.

Poi cominciÃ² da tutte parti un grido
tal, che âl maestro inverso me si feo,
dicendo: Â«Non dubbiar, mentrâ io ti guidoÂ».

âGlorÃ¯a in excelsisâ tutti âDeoâ
dicean, per quel châio daâ vicin compresi,
onde intender lo grido si poteo.

Noâ istavamo immobili e sospesi
come i pastor che prima udir quel canto,
fin che âl tremar cessÃ² ed el compiÃ©si.

Poi ripigliammo nostro cammin santo,
guardando lâombre che giacean per terra,
tornate giÃ  in su lâusato pianto.

Nulla ignoranza mai con tanta guerra
mi fÃ© desideroso di sapere,
se la memoria mia in ciÃ² non erra,

quanta pareami allor, pensando, avere;
nÃ© per la fretta dimandare erâ oso,
nÃ© per me lÃ¬ potea cosa vedere:

cosÃ¬ mâandava timido e pensoso.



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXI


La sete natural che mai non sazia
se non con lâacqua onde la femminetta
samaritana domandÃ² la grazia,

mi travagliava, e pungeami la fretta
per la âmpacciata via dietro al mio duca,
e condoleami a la giusta vendetta.

Ed ecco, sÃ¬ come ne scrive Luca
che Cristo apparve aâ due châerano in via,
giÃ  surto fuor de la sepulcral buca,

ci apparve unâombra, e dietro a noi venÃ¬a,
dal piÃ¨ guardando la turba che giace;
nÃ© ci addemmo di lei, sÃ¬ parlÃ² pria,

dicendo: Â«O frati miei, Dio vi dea paceÂ».
Noi ci volgemmo sÃ¹biti, e Virgilio
rendÃ©li âl cenno châa ciÃ² si conface.

Poi cominciÃ²: Â«Nel beato concilio
ti ponga in pace la verace corte
che me rilega ne lâetterno essilioÂ».

Â«Come!Â», dissâ elli, e parte andavam forte:
Â«se voi siete ombre che Dio sÃ¹ non degni,
chi vâha per la sua scala tanto scorte?Â».

E âl dottor mio: Â«Se tu riguardi aâ segni
che questi porta e che lâangel profila,
ben vedrai che coi buon convien châeâ regni.

Ma perchÃ© lei che dÃ¬ e notte fila
non li avea tratta ancora la conocchia
che Cloto impone a ciascuno e compila,

lâanima sua, châÃ¨ tua e mia serocchia,
venendo sÃ¹, non potea venir sola,
perÃ² châal nostro modo non adocchia.

Ondâ io fui tratto fuor de lâampia gola
dâinferno per mostrarli, e mosterrolli
oltre, quanto âl potrÃ  menar mia scola.

Ma dimmi, se tu sai, perchÃ© tai crolli
diÃ¨ dianzi âl monte, e perchÃ© tutto ad una
parve gridare infino aâ suoi piÃ¨ molliÂ».

SÃ¬ mi diÃ¨, dimandando, per la cruna
del mio disio, che pur con la speranza
si fece la mia sete men digiuna.

Quei cominciÃ²: Â«Cosa non Ã¨ che sanza
ordine senta la religÃ¯one
de la montagna, o che sia fuor dâusanza.

Libero Ã¨ qui da ogne alterazione:
di quel che âl ciel da sÃ© in sÃ© riceve
esser ci puote, e non dâaltro, cagione.

Per che non pioggia, non grando, non neve,
non rugiada, non brina piÃ¹ sÃ¹ cade
che la scaletta di tre gradi breve;

nuvole spesse non paion nÃ© rade,
nÃ© coruscar, nÃ© figlia di Taumante,
che di lÃ  cangia sovente contrade;

secco vapor non surge piÃ¹ avante
châal sommo dâi tre gradi châio parlai,
dovâ ha âl vicario di Pietro le piante.

Trema forse piÃ¹ giÃ¹ poco o assai;
ma per vento che ân terra si nasconda,
non so come, qua sÃ¹ non tremÃ² mai.

Tremaci quando alcuna anima monda
sentesi, sÃ¬ che surga o che si mova
per salir sÃ¹; e tal grido seconda.

De la mondizia sol voler fa prova,
che, tutto libero a mutar convento,
lâalma sorprende, e di voler le giova.

Prima vuol ben, ma non lascia il talento
che divina giustizia, contra voglia,
come fu al peccar, pone al tormento.

E io, che son giaciuto a questa doglia
cinquecentâ anni e piÃ¹, pur mo sentii
libera volontÃ  di miglior soglia:

perÃ² sentisti il tremoto e li pii
spiriti per lo monte render lode
a quel Segnor, che tosto sÃ¹ li ânviiÂ».

CosÃ¬ ne disse; e perÃ² châel si gode
tanto del ber quantâ Ã¨ grande la sete,
non saprei dir quantâ el mi fece prode.

E âl savio duca: Â«Omai veggio la rete
che qui vi âmpiglia e come si scalappia,
perchÃ© ci trema e di che congaudete.

Ora chi fosti, piacciati châio sappia,
e perchÃ© tanti secoli giaciuto
qui seâ, ne le parole tue mi cappiaÂ».

Â«Nel tempo che âl buon Tito, con lâaiuto
del sommo rege, vendicÃ² le fÃ³ra
ondâ uscÃ¬ âl sangue per Giuda venduto,

col nome che piÃ¹ dura e piÃ¹ onora
era io di lÃ Â», rispuose quello spirto,
Â«famoso assai, ma non con fede ancora.

Tanto fu dolce mio vocale spirto,
che, tolosano, a sÃ© mi trasse Roma,
dove mertai le tempie ornar di mirto.

Stazio la gente ancor di lÃ  mi noma:
cantai di Tebe, e poi del grande Achille;
ma caddi in via con la seconda soma.

Al mio ardor fuor seme le faville,
che mi scaldar, de la divina fiamma
onde sono allumati piÃ¹ di mille;

de lâEneÃ¯da dico, la qual mamma
fummi, e fummi nutrice, poetando:
sanzâ essa non fermai peso di dramma.

E per esser vivuto di lÃ  quando
visse Virgilio, assentirei un sole
piÃ¹ che non deggio al mio uscir di bandoÂ».

Volser Virgilio a me queste parole
con viso che, tacendo, disse âTaciâ;
ma non puÃ² tutto la virtÃ¹ che vuole;

chÃ© riso e pianto son tanto seguaci
a la passion di che ciascun si spicca,
che men seguon voler neâ piÃ¹ veraci.

Io pur sorrisi come lâuom châammicca;
per che lâombra si tacque, e riguardommi
ne li occhi ove âl sembiante piÃ¹ si ficca;

e Â«Se tanto labore in bene assommiÂ»,
disse, Â«perchÃ© la tua faccia testeso
un lampeggiar di riso dimostrommi?Â».

Or son io dâuna parte e dâaltra preso:
lâuna mi fa tacer, lâaltra scongiura
châio dica; ondâ io sospiro, e sono inteso

dal mio maestro, e Â«Non aver pauraÂ»,
mi dice, Â«di parlar; ma parla e digli
quel châeâ dimanda con cotanta curaÂ».

Ondâ io: Â«Forse che tu ti maravigli,
antico spirto, del rider châio fei;
ma piÃ¹ dâammirazion voâ che ti pigli.

Questi che guida in alto li occhi miei,
Ã¨ quel Virgilio dal qual tu togliesti
forte a cantar de li uomini e dâi dÃ¨i.

Se cagion altra al mio rider credesti,
lasciala per non vera, ed esser credi
quelle parole che di lui dicestiÂ».

GiÃ  sâinchinava ad abbracciar li piedi
al mio dottor, ma el li disse: Â«Frate,
non far, chÃ© tu seâ ombra e ombra vediÂ».

Ed ei surgendo: Â«Or puoi la quantitate
comprender de lâamor châa te mi scalda,
quandâ io dismento nostra vanitate,

trattando lâombre come cosa saldaÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXII


GiÃ  era lâangel dietro a noi rimaso,
lâangel che nâavea vÃ²lti al sesto giro,
avendomi dal viso un colpo raso;

e quei câhanno a giustizia lor disiro
detto nâavea beati, e le sue voci
con âsitiuntâ, sanzâ altro, ciÃ² forniro.

E io piÃ¹ lieve che per lâaltre foci
mâandava, sÃ¬ che sanzâ alcun labore
seguiva in sÃ¹ li spiriti veloci;

quando Virgilio incominciÃ²: Â«Amore,
acceso di virtÃ¹, sempre altro accese,
pur che la fiamma sua paresse fore;

onde da lâora che tra noi discese
nel limbo de lo ânferno Giovenale,
che la tua affezion mi fÃ© palese,

mia benvoglienza inverso te fu quale
piÃ¹ strinse mai di non vista persona,
sÃ¬ châor mi parran corte queste scale.

Ma dimmi, e come amico mi perdona
se troppa sicurtÃ  mâallarga il freno,
e come amico omai meco ragiona:

come potÃ© trovar dentro al tuo seno
loco avarizia, tra cotanto senno
di quanto per tua cura fosti pieno?Â».

Queste parole Stazio mover fenno
un poco a riso pria; poscia rispuose:
Â«Ogne tuo dir dâamor mâÃ¨ caro cenno.

Veramente piÃ¹ volte appaion cose
che danno a dubitar falsa matera
per le vere ragion che son nascose.

La tua dimanda tuo creder mâavvera
esser châiâ fossi avaro in lâaltra vita,
forse per quella cerchia dovâ io era.

Or sappi châavarizia fu partita
troppo da me, e questa dismisura
migliaia di lunari hanno punita.

E se non fosse châio drizzai mia cura,
quandâ io intesi lÃ  dove tu chiame,
crucciato quasi a lâumana natura:

âPer che non reggi tu, o sacra fame
de lâoro, lâappetito deâ mortali?â,
voltando sentirei le giostre grame.

Allor mâaccorsi che troppo aprir lâali
potean le mani a spendere, e penteâmi
cosÃ¬ di quel come de li altri mali.

Quanti risurgeran coi crini scemi
per ignoranza, che di questa pecca
toglie âl penter vivendo e ne li stremi!

E sappie che la colpa che rimbecca
per dritta opposizione alcun peccato,
con esso insieme qui suo verde secca;

perÃ², sâio son tra quella gente stato
che piange lâavarizia, per purgarmi,
per lo contrario suo mâÃ¨ incontratoÂ».

Â«Or quando tu cantasti le crude armi
de la doppia trestizia di GiocastaÂ»,
disse âl cantor deâ buccolici carmi,

Â«per quello che ClÃ¯Ã² teco lÃ¬ tasta,
non par che ti facesse ancor fedele
la fede, sanza qual ben far non basta.

Se cosÃ¬ Ã¨, qual sole o quai candele
ti stenebraron sÃ¬, che tu drizzasti
poscia di retro al pescator le vele?Â».

Ed elli a lui: Â«Tu prima mâinvÃ¯asti
verso Parnaso a ber ne le sue grotte,
e prima appresso Dio mâalluminasti.

Facesti come quei che va di notte,
che porta il lume dietro e sÃ© non giova,
ma dopo sÃ© fa le persone dotte,

quando dicesti: âSecol si rinova;
torna giustizia e primo tempo umano,
e progenÃ¯e scende da ciel novaâ.

Per te poeta fui, per te cristiano:
ma perchÃ© veggi mei ciÃ² châio disegno,
a colorare stenderÃ² la mano.

GiÃ  era âl mondo tutto quanto pregno
de la vera credenza, seminata
per li messaggi de lâetterno regno;

e la parola tua sopra toccata
si consonava aâ nuovi predicanti;
ondâ io a visitarli presi usata.

Vennermi poi parendo tanto santi,
che, quando Domizian li perseguette,
sanza mio lagrimar non fur lor pianti;

e mentre che di lÃ  per me si stette,
io li sovvenni, e i lor dritti costumi
fer dispregiare a me tutte altre sette.

E pria châio conducessi i Greci aâ fiumi
di Tebe poetando, ebbâ io battesmo;
ma per paura chiuso cristian fuâmi,

lungamente mostrando paganesmo;
e questa tepidezza il quarto cerchio
cerchiar mi fÃ© piÃ¹ che âl quarto centesmo.

Tu dunque, che levato hai il coperchio
che mâascondeva quanto bene io dico,
mentre che del salire avem soverchio,

dimmi dovâ Ã¨ Terrenzio nostro antico,
Cecilio e Plauto e Varro, se lo sai:
dimmi se son dannati, e in qual vicoÂ».

Â«Costoro e Persio e io e altri assaiÂ»,
rispuose il duca mio, Â«siam con quel Greco
che le Muse lattar piÃ¹ châaltri mai,

nel primo cinghio del carcere cieco;
spesse fÃ¯ate ragioniam del monte
che sempre ha le nutrice nostre seco.

Euripide vâÃ¨ nosco e Antifonte,
Simonide, Agatone e altri piÃ¹e
Greci che giÃ  di lauro ornar la fronte.

Quivi si veggion de le genti tue
Antigone, DeÃ¯file e Argia,
e Ismene sÃ¬ trista come fue.

VÃ©deisi quella che mostrÃ² Langia;
Ã¨vvi la figlia di Tiresia, e Teti,
e con le suore sue DeÃ¯damiaÂ».

Tacevansi ambedue giÃ  li poeti,
di novo attenti a riguardar dintorno,
liberi da saliri e da pareti;

e giÃ  le quattro ancelle eran del giorno
rimase a dietro, e la quinta era al temo,
drizzando pur in sÃ¹ lâardente corno,

quando il mio duca: Â«Io credo châa lo stremo
le destre spalle volger ne convegna,
girando il monte come far solemoÂ».

CosÃ¬ lâusanza fu lÃ¬ nostra insegna,
e prendemmo la via con men sospetto
per lâassentir di quellâ anima degna.

Elli givan dinanzi, e io soletto
di retro, e ascoltava i lor sermoni,
châa poetar mi davano intelletto.

Ma tosto ruppe le dolci ragioni
un alber che trovammo in mezza strada,
con pomi a odorar soavi e buoni;

e come abete in alto si digrada
di ramo in ramo, cosÃ¬ quello in giuso,
credâ io, perchÃ© persona sÃ¹ non vada.

Dal lato onde âl cammin nostro era chiuso,
cadea de lâalta roccia un liquor chiaro
e si spandeva per le foglie suso.

Li due poeti a lâalber sâappressaro;
e una voce per entro le fronde
gridÃ²: Â«Di questo cibo avrete caroÂ».

Poi disse: Â«PiÃ¹ pensava Maria onde
fosser le nozze orrevoli e intere,
châa la sua bocca, châor per voi risponde.

E le Romane antiche, per lor bere,
contente furon dâacqua; e DanÃ¯ello
dispregiÃ² cibo e acquistÃ² savere.

Lo secol primo, quantâ oro fu bello,
fÃ© savorose con fame le ghiande,
e nettare con sete ogne ruscello.

Mele e locuste furon le vivande
che nodriro il Batista nel diserto;
per châelli Ã¨ glorÃ¯oso e tanto grande

quanto per lo Vangelio vâÃ¨ apertoÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXIII


Mentre che li occhi per la fronda verde
ficcava Ã¯o sÃ¬ come far suole
chi dietro a li uccellin sua vita perde,

lo piÃ¹ che padre mi dicea: Â«Figliuole,
vienne oramai, chÃ© âl tempo che nâÃ¨ imposto
piÃ¹ utilmente compartir si vuoleÂ».

Io volsi âl viso, e âl passo non men tosto,
appresso i savi, che parlavan sÃ¬e,
che lâandar mi facean di nullo costo.

Ed ecco piangere e cantar sâudÃ¬e
âLabÃ¯a mÃ«a, Domineâ per modo
tal, che diletto e doglia parturÃ¬e.

Â«O dolce padre, che Ã¨ quel châiâ odo?Â»,
cominciaâ io; ed elli: Â«Ombre che vanno
forse di lor dover solvendo il nodoÂ».

SÃ¬ come i peregrin pensosi fanno,
giugnendo per cammin gente non nota,
che si volgono ad essa e non restanno,

cosÃ¬ di retro a noi, piÃ¹ tosto mota,
venendo e trapassando ci ammirava
dâanime turba tacita e devota.

Ne li occhi era ciascuna oscura e cava,
palida ne la faccia, e tanto scema
che da lâossa la pelle sâinformava.

Non credo che cosÃ¬ a buccia strema
Erisittone fosse fatto secco,
per digiunar, quando piÃ¹ nâebbe tema.

Io dicea fra me stesso pensando: âEcco
la gente che perdÃ© Ierusalemme,
quando Maria nel figlio diÃ¨ di becco!â

Parean lâocchiaie anella sanza gemme:
chi nel viso de li uomini legge âomoâ
ben avria quivi conosciuta lâemme.

Chi crederebbe che lâodor dâun pomo
sÃ¬ governasse, generando brama,
e quel dâunâacqua, non sappiendo como?

GiÃ  era in ammirar che sÃ¬ li affama,
per la cagione ancor non manifesta
di lor magrezza e di lor trista squama,

ed ecco del profondo de la testa
volse a me li occhi unâombra e guardÃ² fiso;
poi gridÃ² forte: Â«Qual grazia mâÃ¨ questa?Â».

Mai non lâavrei riconosciuto al viso;
ma ne la voce sua mi fu palese
ciÃ² che lâaspetto in sÃ© avea conquiso.

Questa favilla tutta mi raccese
mia conoscenza a la cangiata labbia,
e ravvisai la faccia di Forese.

Â«Deh, non contendere a lâasciutta scabbia
che mi scoloraÂ», pregava, Â«la pelle,
nÃ© a difetto di carne châio abbia;

ma dimmi il ver di te, dÃ¬ chi son quelle
due anime che lÃ  ti fanno scorta;
non rimaner che tu non mi favelle!Â».

Â«La faccia tua, châio lagrimai giÃ  morta,
mi dÃ  di pianger mo non minor dogliaÂ»,
rispuosâ io lui, Â«veggendola sÃ¬ torta.

PerÃ² mi dÃ¬, per Dio, che sÃ¬ vi sfoglia;
non mi far dir mentrâ io mi maraviglio,
chÃ© mal puÃ² dir chi Ã¨ pien dâaltra vogliaÂ».

Ed elli a me: Â«De lâetterno consiglio
cade vertÃ¹ ne lâacqua e ne la pianta
rimasa dietro ondâ io sÃ¬ mâassottiglio.

Tutta esta gente che piangendo canta
per seguitar la gola oltra misura,
in fame e ân sete qui si rifÃ  santa.

Di bere e di mangiar nâaccende cura
lâodor châesce del pomo e de lo sprazzo
che si distende su per sua verdura.

E non pur una volta, questo spazzo
girando, si rinfresca nostra pena:
io dico pena, e dovria dir sollazzo,

chÃ© quella voglia a li alberi ci mena
che menÃ² Cristo lieto a dire âElÃ¬â,
quando ne liberÃ² con la sua venaÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Forese, da quel dÃ¬
nel qual mutasti mondo a miglior vita,
cinquâ anni non son vÃ²lti infino a qui.

Se prima fu la possa in te finita
di peccar piÃ¹, che sovvenisse lâora
del buon dolor châa Dio ne rimarita,

come seâ tu qua sÃ¹ venuto ancora?
Io ti credea trovar lÃ  giÃ¹ di sotto,
dove tempo per tempo si ristoraÂ».

Ondâ elli a me: Â«SÃ¬ tosto mâha condotto
a ber lo dolce assenzo dâi martÃ¬ri
la Nella mia con suo pianger dirotto.

Con suoi prieghi devoti e con sospiri
tratto mâha de la costa ove sâaspetta,
e liberato mâha de li altri giri.

Tanto Ã¨ a Dio piÃ¹ cara e piÃ¹ diletta
la vedovella mia, che molto amai,
quanto in bene operare Ã¨ piÃ¹ soletta;

chÃ© la Barbagia di Sardigna assai
ne le femmine sue piÃ¹ Ã¨ pudica
che la Barbagia dovâ io la lasciai.

O dolce frate, che vuoâ tu châio dica?
Tempo futuro mâÃ¨ giÃ  nel cospetto,
cui non sarÃ  questâ ora molto antica,

nel qual sarÃ  in pergamo interdetto
a le sfacciate donne fiorentine
lâandar mostrando con le poppe il petto.

Quai barbare fuor mai, quai saracine,
cui bisognasse, per farle ir coperte,
o spiritali o altre discipline?

Ma se le svergognate fosser certe
di quel che âl ciel veloce loro ammanna,
giÃ  per urlare avrian le bocche aperte;

chÃ©, se lâantiveder qui non mâinganna,
prima fien triste che le guance impeli
colui che mo si consola con nanna.

Deh, frate, or fa che piÃ¹ non mi ti celi!
vedi che non pur io, ma questa gente
tutta rimira lÃ  dove âl sol veliÂ».

Per châio a lui: Â«Se tu riduci a mente
qual fosti meco, e qual io teco fui,
ancor fia grave il memorar presente.

Di quella vita mi volse costui
che mi va innanzi, lâaltrâ ier, quando tonda
vi si mostrÃ² la suora di coluiÂ»,

e âl sol mostrai; Â«costui per la profonda
notte menato mâha dâi veri morti
con questa vera carne che âl seconda.

Indi mâhan tratto sÃ¹ li suoi conforti,
salendo e rigirando la montagna
che drizza voi che âl mondo fece torti.

Tanto dice di farmi sua compagna
che io sarÃ² lÃ  dove fia Beatrice;
quivi convien che sanza lui rimagna.

Virgilio Ã¨ questi che cosÃ¬ mi diceÂ»,
e additaâlo; Â«e questâ altro Ã¨ quellâ ombra
per cuÃ¯ scosse dianzi ogne pendice

lo vostro regno, che da sÃ© lo sgombraÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXIV


NÃ© âl dir lâandar, nÃ© lâandar lui piÃ¹ lento
facea, ma ragionando andavam forte,
sÃ¬ come nave pinta da buon vento;

e lâombre, che parean cose rimorte,
per le fosse de li occhi ammirazione
traean di me, di mio vivere accorte.

E io, continÃ¼ando al mio sermone,
dissi: Â«Ella sen va sÃ¹ forse piÃ¹ tarda
che non farebbe, per altrui cagione.

Ma dimmi, se tu sai, dovâ Ã¨ Piccarda;
dimmi sâio veggio da notar persona
tra questa gente che sÃ¬ mi riguardaÂ».

Â«La mia sorella, che tra bella e buona
non so qual fosse piÃ¹, trÃ¯unfa lieta
ne lâalto Olimpo giÃ  di sua coronaÂ».

SÃ¬ disse prima; e poi: Â«Qui non si vieta
di nominar ciascun, da châÃ¨ sÃ¬ munta
nostra sembianza via per la dÃ¯eta.

QuestiÂ», e mostrÃ² col dito, Â«Ã¨ Bonagiunta,
Bonagiunta da Lucca; e quella faccia
di lÃ  da lui piÃ¹ che lâaltre trapunta

ebbe la Santa Chiesa in le sue braccia:
dal Torso fu, e purga per digiuno
lâanguille di Bolsena e la vernacciaÂ».

Molti altri mi nomÃ² ad uno ad uno;
e del nomar parean tutti contenti,
sÃ¬ châio perÃ² non vidi un atto bruno.

Vidi per fame a vÃ²to usar li denti
Ubaldin da la Pila e Bonifazio
che pasturÃ² col rocco molte genti.

Vidi messer Marchese, châebbe spazio
giÃ  di bere a ForlÃ¬ con men secchezza,
e sÃ¬ fu tal, che non si sentÃ¬ sazio.

Ma come fa chi guarda e poi sâapprezza
piÃ¹ dâun che dâaltro, fei a quel da Lucca,
che piÃ¹ parea di me aver contezza.

El mormorava; e non so che Â«GentuccaÂ»
sentivâ io lÃ , ovâ el sentia la piaga
de la giustizia che sÃ¬ li pilucca.

Â«O animaÂ», dissâ io, Â«che par sÃ¬ vaga
di parlar meco, fa sÃ¬ châio tâintenda,
e te e me col tuo parlare appagaÂ».

Â«Femmina Ã¨ nata, e non porta ancor bendaÂ»,
cominciÃ² el, Â«che ti farÃ  piacere
la mia cittÃ , come châom la riprenda.

Tu te nâandrai con questo antivedere:
se nel mio mormorar prendesti errore,
dichiareranti ancor le cose vere.

Ma dÃ¬ sâiâ veggio qui colui che fore
trasse le nove rime, cominciando
âDonne châavete intelletto dâamoreâÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Iâ mi son un che, quando
Amor mi spira, noto, e a quel modo
châeâ ditta dentro vo significandoÂ».

Â«O frate, issa veggâ ioÂ», dissâ elli, Â«il nodo
che âl Notaro e Guittone e me ritenne
di qua dal dolce stil novo châiâ odo!

Io veggio ben come le vostre penne
di retro al dittator sen vanno strette,
che de le nostre certo non avvenne;

e qual piÃ¹ a gradire oltre si mette,
non vede piÃ¹ da lâuno a lâaltro stiloÂ»;
e, quasi contentato, si tacette.

Come li augei che vernan lungo âl Nilo,
alcuna volta in aere fanno schiera,
poi volan piÃ¹ a fretta e vanno in filo,

cosÃ¬ tutta la gente che lÃ¬ era,
volgendo âl viso, raffrettÃ² suo passo,
e per magrezza e per voler leggera.

E come lâuom che di trottare Ã¨ lasso,
lascia andar li compagni, e sÃ¬ passeggia
fin che si sfoghi lâaffollar del casso,

sÃ¬ lasciÃ² trapassar la santa greggia
Forese, e dietro meco sen veniva,
dicendo: Â«Quando fia châio ti riveggia?Â».

Â«Non soÂ», rispuosâ io lui, Â«quantâ io mi viva;
ma giÃ  non fÃ¯a il tornar mio tantosto,
châio non sia col voler prima a la riva;

perÃ² che âl loco uâ fui a viver posto,
di giorno in giorno piÃ¹ di ben si spolpa,
e a trista ruina par dispostoÂ».

Â«Or vaÂ», dissâ el; Â«che quei che piÃ¹ nâha colpa,
veggâ Ã¯o a coda dâuna bestia tratto
inverâ la valle ove mai non si scolpa.

La bestia ad ogne passo va piÃ¹ ratto,
crescendo sempre, fin châella il percuote,
e lascia il corpo vilmente disfatto.

Non hanno molto a volger quelle ruoteÂ»,
e drizzÃ² li occhi al ciel, Â«che ti fia chiaro
ciÃ² che âl mio dir piÃ¹ dichiarar non puote.

Tu ti rimani omai; chÃ© âl tempo Ã¨ caro
in questo regno, sÃ¬ châio perdo troppo
venendo teco sÃ¬ a paro a paroÂ».

Qual esce alcuna volta di gualoppo
lo cavalier di schiera che cavalchi,
e va per farsi onor del primo intoppo,

tal si partÃ¬ da noi con maggior valchi;
e io rimasi in via con esso i due
che fuor del mondo sÃ¬ gran marescalchi.

E quando innanzi a noi intrato fue,
che li occhi miei si fero a lui seguaci,
come la mente a le parole sue,

parvermi i rami gravidi e vivaci
dâun altro pomo, e non molto lontani
per esser pur allora vÃ²lto in laci.

Vidi gente sottâ esso alzar le mani
e gridar non so che verso le fronde,
quasi bramosi fantolini e vani

che pregano, e âl pregato non risponde,
ma, per fare esser ben la voglia acuta,
tien alto lor disio e nol nasconde.

Poi si partÃ¬ sÃ¬ come ricreduta;
e noi venimmo al grande arbore adesso,
che tanti prieghi e lagrime rifiuta.

Â«Trapassate oltre sanza farvi presso:
legno Ã¨ piÃ¹ sÃ¹ che fu morso da Eva,
e questa pianta si levÃ² da essoÂ».

SÃ¬ tra le frasche non so chi diceva;
per che Virgilio e Stazio e io, ristretti,
oltre andavam dal lato che si leva.

Â«RicordiviÂ», dicea, Â«dâi maladetti
nei nuvoli formati, che, satolli,
TesÃ«o combatter coâ doppi petti;

e de li Ebrei châal ber si mostrar molli,
per che no i volle Gedeon compagni,
quando inverâ MadÃ¯an discese i colliÂ».

SÃ¬ accostati a lâun dâi due vivagni
passammo, udendo colpe de la gola
seguite giÃ  da miseri guadagni.

Poi, rallargati per la strada sola,
ben mille passi e piÃ¹ ci portar oltre,
contemplando ciascun sanza parola.

Â«Che andate pensando sÃ¬ voi sol tre?Â».
sÃ¹bita voce disse; ondâ io mi scossi
come fan bestie spaventate e poltre.

Drizzai la testa per veder chi fossi;
e giÃ  mai non si videro in fornace
vetri o metalli sÃ¬ lucenti e rossi,

comâ io vidi un che dicea: Â«Sâa voi piace
montare in sÃ¹, qui si convien dar volta;
quinci si va chi vuole andar per paceÂ».

Lâaspetto suo mâavea la vista tolta;
per châio mi volsi dietro aâ miei dottori,
comâ om che va secondo châelli ascolta.

E quale, annunziatrice de li albori,
lâaura di maggio movesi e olezza,
tutta impregnata da lâerba e daâ fiori;

tal mi sentiâ un vento dar per mezza
la fronte, e ben sentiâ mover la piuma,
che fÃ© sentir dâambrosÃ¯a lâorezza.

E sentiâ dir: Â«Beati cui alluma
tanto di grazia, che lâamor del gusto
nel petto lor troppo disir non fuma,

esurÃ¯endo sempre quanto Ã¨ giusto!Â».



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXV


Ora era onde âl salir non volea storpio;
chÃ© âl sole avÃ«a il cerchio di merigge
lasciato al Tauro e la notte a lo Scorpio:

per che, come fa lâuom che non sâaffigge
ma vassi a la via sua, che che li appaia,
se di bisogno stimolo il trafigge,

cosÃ¬ intrammo noi per la callaia,
uno innanzi altro prendendo la scala
che per artezza i salitor dispaia.

E quale il cicognin che leva lâala
per voglia di volare, e non sâattenta
dâabbandonar lo nido, e giÃ¹ la cala;

tal era io con voglia accesa e spenta
di dimandar, venendo infino a lâatto
che fa colui châa dicer sâargomenta.

Non lasciÃ², per lâandar che fosse ratto,
lo dolce padre mio, ma disse: Â«Scocca
lâarco del dir, che ânfino al ferro hai trattoÂ».

Allor sicuramente apriâ la bocca
e cominciai: Â«Come si puÃ² far magro
lÃ  dove lâuopo di nodrir non tocca?Â».

Â«Se tâammentassi come Meleagro
si consumÃ² al consumar dâun stizzo,
non foraÂ», disse, Â«a te questo sÃ¬ agro;

e se pensassi come, al vostro guizzo,
guizza dentro a lo specchio vostra image,
ciÃ² che par duro ti parrebbe vizzo.

Ma perchÃ© dentro a tuo voler tâadage,
ecco qui Stazio; e io lui chiamo e prego
che sia or sanator de le tue piageÂ».

Â«Se la veduta etterna li dislegoÂ»,
rispuose Stazio, Â«lÃ  dove tu sie,
discolpi me non potertâ io far negoÂ».

Poi cominciÃ²: Â«Se le parole mie,
figlio, la mente tua guarda e riceve,
lume ti fiero al come che tu die.

Sangue perfetto, che poi non si beve
da lâassetate vene, e si rimane
quasi alimento che di mensa leve,

prende nel core a tutte membra umane
virtute informativa, come quello
châa farsi quelle per le vene vane.

Ancor digesto, scende ovâ Ã¨ piÃ¹ bello
tacer che dire; e quindi poscia geme
sovrâ altrui sangue in natural vasello.

Ivi sâaccoglie lâuno e lâaltro insieme,
lâun disposto a patire, e lâaltro a fare
per lo perfetto loco onde si preme;

e, giunto lui, comincia ad operare
coagulando prima, e poi avviva
ciÃ² che per sua matera fÃ© constare.

Anima fatta la virtute attiva
qual dâuna pianta, in tanto differente,
che questa Ã¨ in via e quella Ã¨ giÃ  a riva,

tanto ovra poi, che giÃ  si move e sente,
come spungo marino; e indi imprende
ad organar le posse ondâ Ã¨ semente.

Or si spiega, figliuolo, or si distende
la virtÃ¹ châÃ¨ dal cor del generante,
dove natura a tutte membra intende.

Ma come dâanimal divegna fante,
non vedi tu ancor: questâ Ã¨ tal punto,
che piÃ¹ savio di te fÃ© giÃ  errante,

sÃ¬ che per sua dottrina fÃ© disgiunto
da lâanima il possibile intelletto,
perchÃ© da lui non vide organo assunto.

Apri a la veritÃ  che viene il petto;
e sappi che, sÃ¬ tosto come al feto
lâarticular del cerebro Ã¨ perfetto,

lo motor primo a lui si volge lieto
sovra tantâ arte di natura, e spira
spirito novo, di vertÃ¹ repleto,

che ciÃ² che trova attivo quivi, tira
in sua sustanzia, e fassi unâalma sola,
che vive e sente e sÃ© in sÃ© rigira.

E perchÃ© meno ammiri la parola,
guarda il calor del sole che si fa vino,
giunto a lâomor che de la vite cola.

Quando LÃ chesis non ha piÃ¹ del lino,
solvesi da la carne, e in virtute
ne porta seco e lâumano e âl divino:

lâaltre potenze tutte quante mute;
memoria, intelligenza e volontade
in atto molto piÃ¹ che prima agute.

Sanza restarsi, per sÃ© stessa cade
mirabilmente a lâuna de le rive;
quivi conosce prima le sue strade.

Tosto che loco lÃ¬ la circunscrive,
la virtÃ¹ formativa raggia intorno
cosÃ¬ e quanto ne le membra vive.

E come lâaere, quandâ Ã¨ ben pÃ¯orno,
per lâaltrui raggio che ân sÃ© si reflette,
di diversi color diventa addorno;

cosÃ¬ lâaere vicin quivi si mette
e in quella forma châÃ¨ in lui suggella
virtÃ¼almente lâalma che ristette;

e simigliante poi a la fiammella
che segue il foco lÃ  âvunque si muta,
segue lo spirto sua forma novella.

PerÃ² che quindi ha poscia sua paruta,
Ã¨ chiamata ombra; e quindi organa poi
ciascun sentire infino a la veduta.

Quindi parliamo e quindi ridiam noi;
quindi facciam le lagrime e â sospiri
che per lo monte aver sentiti puoi.

Secondo che ci affliggono i disiri
e li altri affetti, lâombra si figura;
e questâ Ã¨ la cagion di che tu miriÂ».

E giÃ  venuto a lâultima tortura
sâera per noi, e vÃ²lto a la man destra,
ed eravamo attenti ad altra cura.

Quivi la ripa fiamma in fuor balestra,
e la cornice spira fiato in suso
che la reflette e via da lei sequestra;

ondâ ir ne convenia dal lato schiuso
ad uno ad uno; e io temÃ«a âl foco
quinci, e quindi temeva cader giuso.

Lo duca mio dicea: Â«Per questo loco
si vuol tenere a li occhi stretto il freno,
perÃ² châerrar potrebbesi per pocoÂ».

âSummae Deus clementÃ¯aeâ nel seno
al grande ardore allora udiâ cantando,
che di volger mi fÃ© caler non meno;

e vidi spirti per la fiamma andando;
per châio guardava a loro e aâ miei passi
compartendo la vista a quando a quando.

Appresso il fine châa quellâ inno fassi,
gridavano alto: âVirum non cognoscoâ;
indi ricominciavan lâinno bassi.

Finitolo, anco gridavano: Â«Al bosco
si tenne Diana, ed Elice caccionne
che di Venere avea sentito il tÃ²scoÂ».

Indi al cantar tornavano; indi donne
gridavano e mariti che fuor casti
come virtute e matrimonio imponne.

E questo modo credo che lor basti
per tutto il tempo che âl foco li abbruscia:
con tal cura conviene e con tai pasti

che la piaga da sezzo si ricuscia.



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXVI


Mentre che sÃ¬ per lâorlo, uno innanzi altro,
ce nâandavamo, e spesso il buon maestro
diceami: Â«Guarda: giovi châio ti scaltroÂ»;

feriami il sole in su lâomero destro,
che giÃ , raggiando, tutto lâoccidente
mutava in bianco aspetto di cilestro;

e io facea con lâombra piÃ¹ rovente
parer la fiamma; e pur a tanto indizio
vidi moltâ ombre, andando, poner mente.

Questa fu la cagion che diede inizio
loro a parlar di me; e cominciarsi
a dir: Â«Colui non par corpo fittizioÂ»;

poi verso me, quanto potÃ«an farsi,
certi si fero, sempre con riguardo
di non uscir dove non fosser arsi.

Â«O tu che vai, non per esser piÃ¹ tardo,
ma forse reverente, a li altri dopo,
rispondi a me che ân sete e ân foco ardo.

NÃ© solo a me la tua risposta Ã¨ uopo;
chÃ© tutti questi nâhanno maggior sete
che dâacqua fredda Indo o EtÃ¯opo.

Dinne comâ Ã¨ che fai di te parete
al sol, pur come tu non fossi ancora
di morte intrato dentro da la reteÂ».

SÃ¬ mi parlava un dâessi; e io mi fora
giÃ  manifesto, sâio non fossi atteso
ad altra novitÃ  châapparve allora;

chÃ© per lo mezzo del cammino acceso
venne gente col viso incontro a questa,
la qual mi fece a rimirar sospeso.

LÃ¬ veggio dâogne parte farsi presta
ciascunâ ombra e basciarsi una con una
sanza restar, contente a brieve festa;

cosÃ¬ per entro loro schiera bruna
sâammusa lâuna con lâaltra formica,
forse a spÃ¯ar lor via e lor fortuna.

Tosto che parton lâaccoglienza amica,
prima che âl primo passo lÃ¬ trascorra,
sopragridar ciascuna sâaffatica:

la nova gente: Â«Soddoma e GomorraÂ»;
e lâaltra: Â«Ne la vacca entra Pasife,
perchÃ© âl torello a sua lussuria corraÂ».

Poi, come grue châa le montagne Rife
volasser parte, e parte inverâ lâarene,
queste del gel, quelle del sole schife,

lâuna gente sen va, lâaltra sen vene;
e tornan, lagrimando, aâ primi canti
e al gridar che piÃ¹ lor si convene;

e raccostansi a me, come davanti,
essi medesmi che mâavean pregato,
attenti ad ascoltar neâ lor sembianti.

Io, che due volte avea visto lor grato,
incominciai: Â«O anime sicure
dâaver, quando che sia, di pace stato,

non son rimase acerbe nÃ© mature
le membra mie di lÃ , ma son qui meco
col sangue suo e con le sue giunture.

Quinci sÃ¹ vo per non esser piÃ¹ cieco;
donna Ã¨ di sopra che mâacquista grazia,
per che âl mortal per vostro mondo reco.

Ma se la vostra maggior voglia sazia
tosto divegna, sÃ¬ che âl ciel vâalberghi
châÃ¨ pien dâamore e piÃ¹ ampio si spazia,

ditemi, acciÃ² châancor carte ne verghi,
chi siete voi, e chi Ã¨ quella turba
che se ne va di retro aâ vostri terghiÂ».

Non altrimenti stupido si turba
lo montanaro, e rimirando ammuta,
quando rozzo e salvatico sâinurba,

che ciascunâ ombra fece in sua paruta;
ma poi che furon di stupore scarche,
lo qual ne li alti cuor tosto sâattuta,

Â«Beato te, che de le nostre marcheÂ»,
ricominciÃ² colei che pria mâinchiese,
Â«per morir meglio, esperÃ¯enza imbarche!

La gente che non vien con noi, offese
di ciÃ² per che giÃ  Cesar, trÃ¯unfando,
âReginaâ contra sÃ© chiamar sâintese:

perÃ² si parton âSoddomaâ gridando,
rimproverando a sÃ© comâ hai udito,
e aiutan lâarsura vergognando.

Nostro peccato fu ermafrodito;
ma perchÃ© non servammo umana legge,
seguendo come bestie lâappetito,

in obbrobrio di noi, per noi si legge,
quando partinci, il nome di colei
che sâimbestiÃ² ne le âmbestiate schegge.

Or sai nostri atti e di che fummo rei:
se forse a nome vuoâ saper chi semo,
tempo non Ã¨ di dire, e non saprei.

Farotti ben di me volere scemo:
son Guido Guinizzelli, e giÃ  mi purgo
per ben dolermi prima châa lo stremoÂ».

Quali ne la tristizia di Ligurgo
si fer due figli a riveder la madre,
tal mi fecâ io, ma non a tanto insurgo,

quandâ io odo nomar sÃ© stesso il padre
mio e de li altri miei miglior che mai
rime dâamore usar dolci e leggiadre;

e sanza udire e dir pensoso andai
lunga fÃ¯ata rimirando lui,
nÃ©, per lo foco, in lÃ  piÃ¹ mâappressai.

Poi che di riguardar pasciuto fui,
tutto mâoffersi pronto al suo servigio
con lâaffermar che fa credere altrui.

Ed elli a me: Â«Tu lasci tal vestigio,
per quel châiâ odo, in me, e tanto chiaro,
che LetÃ¨ nol puÃ² tÃ²rre nÃ© far bigio.

Ma se le tue parole or ver giuraro,
dimmi che Ã¨ cagion per che dimostri
nel dire e nel guardar dâavermi caroÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Li dolci detti vostri,
che, quanto durerÃ  lâuso moderno,
faranno cari ancora i loro incostriÂ».

Â«O frateÂ», disse, Â«questi châio ti cerno
col ditoÂ», e additÃ² un spirto innanzi,
Â«fu miglior fabbro del parlar materno.

Versi dâamore e prose di romanzi
soverchiÃ² tutti; e lascia dir li stolti
che quel di LemosÃ¬ credon châavanzi.

A voce piÃ¹ châal ver drizzan li volti,
e cosÃ¬ ferman sua oppinÃ¯one
prima châarte o ragion per lor sâascolti.

CosÃ¬ fer molti antichi di Guittone,
di grido in grido pur lui dando pregio,
fin che lâha vinto il ver con piÃ¹ persone.

Or se tu hai sÃ¬ ampio privilegio,
che licito ti sia lâandare al chiostro
nel quale Ã¨ Cristo abate del collegio,

falli per me un dir dâun paternostro,
quanto bisogna a noi di questo mondo,
dove poter peccar non Ã¨ piÃ¹ nostroÂ».

Poi, forse per dar luogo altrui secondo
che presso avea, disparve per lo foco,
come per lâacqua il pesce andando al fondo.

Io mi fei al mostrato innanzi un poco,
e dissi châal suo nome il mio disire
apparecchiava grazÃ¯oso loco.

El cominciÃ² liberamente a dire:
Â«Tan mâabellis vostre cortes deman,
quâieu no me puesc ni voill a vos cobrire.

Ieu sui Arnaut, que plor e vau cantan;
consiros vei la passada folor,
e vei jausen lo joi quâesper, denan.

Ara vos prec, per aquella valor
que vos guida al som de lâescalina,
sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor!Â».

Poi sâascose nel foco che li affina.



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXVII


SÃ¬ come quando i primi raggi vibra
lÃ  dove il suo fattor lo sangue sparse,
cadendo Ibero sotto lâalta Libra,

e lâonde in Gange da nona rÃ¯arse,
sÃ¬ stava il sole; onde âl giorno sen giva,
come lâangel di Dio lieto ci apparse.

Fuor de la fiamma stava in su la riva,
e cantava âBeati mundo corde!â
in voce assai piÃ¹ che la nostra viva.

Poscia Â«PiÃ¹ non si va, se pria non morde,
anime sante, il foco: intrate in esso,
e al cantar di lÃ  non siate sordeÂ»,

ci disse come noi li fummo presso;
per châio divenni tal, quando lo ântesi,
qual Ã¨ colui che ne la fossa Ã¨ messo.

In su le man commesse mi protesi,
guardando il foco e imaginando forte
umani corpi giÃ  veduti accesi.

Volsersi verso me le buone scorte;
e Virgilio mi disse: Â«Figliuol mio,
qui puÃ² esser tormento, ma non morte.

Ricorditi, ricorditi! E se io
sovresso GerÃ¯on ti guidai salvo,
che farÃ² ora presso piÃ¹ a Dio?

Credi per certo che se dentro a lâalvo
di questa fiamma stessi ben mille anni,
non ti potrebbe far dâun capel calvo.

E se tu forse credi châio tâinganni,
fatti verâ lei, e fatti far credenza
con le tue mani al lembo dâi tuoi panni.

Pon giÃ¹ omai, pon giÃ¹ ogne temenza;
volgiti in qua e vieni: entra sicuro!Â».
E io pur fermo e contra coscÃ¯enza.

Quando mi vide star pur fermo e duro,
turbato un poco disse: Â«Or vedi, figlio:
tra BÃ«atrice e te Ã¨ questo muroÂ».

Come al nome di Tisbe aperse il ciglio
Piramo in su la morte, e riguardolla,
allor che âl gelso diventÃ² vermiglio;

cosÃ¬, la mia durezza fatta solla,
mi volsi al savio duca, udendo il nome
che ne la mente sempre mi rampolla.

Ondâ ei crollÃ² la fronte e disse: Â«Come!
volenci star di qua?Â»; indi sorrise
come al fanciul si fa châÃ¨ vinto al pome.

Poi dentro al foco innanzi mi si mise,
pregando Stazio che venisse retro,
che pria per lunga strada ci divise.

SÃ¬ comâ fui dentro, in un bogliente vetro
gittato mi sarei per rinfrescarmi,
tantâ era ivi lo âncendio sanza metro.

Lo dolce padre mio, per confortarmi,
pur di Beatrice ragionando andava,
dicendo: Â«Li occhi suoi giÃ  veder parmiÂ».

Guidavaci una voce che cantava
di lÃ ; e noi, attenti pur a lei,
venimmo fuor lÃ  ove si montava.

âVenite, benedicti Patris meiâ,
sonÃ² dentro a un lume che lÃ¬ era,
tal che mi vinse e guardar nol potei.

Â«Lo sol sen vaÂ», soggiunse, Â«e vien la sera;
non vâarrestate, ma studiate il passo,
mentre che lâoccidente non si anneraÂ».

Dritta salia la via per entro âl sasso
verso tal parte châio toglieva i raggi
dinanzi a me del sol châera giÃ  basso.

E di pochi scaglion levammo i saggi,
che âl sol corcar, per lâombra che si spense,
sentimmo dietro e io e li miei saggi.

E pria che ân tutte le sue parti immense
fosse orizzonte fatto dâuno aspetto,
e notte avesse tutte sue dispense,

ciascun di noi dâun grado fece letto;
chÃ© la natura del monte ci affranse
la possa del salir piÃ¹ e âl diletto.

Quali si stanno ruminando manse
le capre, state rapide e proterve
sovra le cime avante che sien pranse,

tacite a lâombra, mentre che âl sol ferve,
guardate dal pastor, che ân su la verga
poggiato sâÃ¨ e lor di posa serve;

e quale il mandrÃ¯an che fori alberga,
lungo il pecuglio suo queto pernotta,
guardando perchÃ© fiera non lo sperga;

tali eravamo tutti e tre allotta,
io come capra, ed ei come pastori,
fasciati quinci e quindi dâalta grotta.

Poco parer potea lÃ¬ del di fori;
ma, per quel poco, vedea io le stelle
di lor solere e piÃ¹ chiare e maggiori.

SÃ¬ ruminando e sÃ¬ mirando in quelle,
mi prese il sonno; il sonno che sovente,
anzi che âl fatto sia, sa le novelle.

Ne lâora, credo, che de lâorÃ¯ente
prima raggiÃ² nel monte Citerea,
che di foco dâamor par sempre ardente,

giovane e bella in sogno mi parea
donna vedere andar per una landa
cogliendo fiori; e cantando dicea:

Â«Sappia qualunque il mio nome dimanda
châiâ mi son Lia, e vo movendo intorno
le belle mani a farmi una ghirlanda.

Per piacermi a lo specchio, qui mâaddorno;
ma mia suora Rachel mai non si smaga
dal suo miraglio, e siede tutto giorno.

Ellâ Ã¨ dâi suoi belli occhi veder vaga
comâ io de lâaddornarmi con le mani;
lei lo vedere, e me lâovrare appagaÂ».

E giÃ  per li splendori antelucani,
che tanto aâ pellegrin surgon piÃ¹ grati,
quanto, tornando, albergan men lontani,

le tenebre fuggian da tutti lati,
e âl sonno mio con esse; ondâ io levaâmi,
veggendo i gran maestri giÃ  levati.

Â«Quel dolce pome che per tanti rami
cercando va la cura deâ mortali,
oggi porrÃ  in pace le tue famiÂ».

Virgilio inverso me queste cotali
parole usÃ²; e mai non furo strenne
che fosser di piacere a queste iguali.

Tanto voler sopra voler mi venne
de lâesser sÃ¹, châad ogne passo poi
al volo mi sentia crescer le penne.

Come la scala tutta sotto noi
fu corsa e fummo in su âl grado superno,
in me ficcÃ² Virgilio li occhi suoi,

e disse: Â«Il temporal foco e lâetterno
veduto hai, figlio; e seâ venuto in parte
dovâ io per me piÃ¹ oltre non discerno.

Tratto tâho qui con ingegno e con arte;
lo tuo piacere omai prendi per duce;
fuor seâ de lâerte vie, fuor seâ de lâarte.

Vedi lo sol che ân fronte ti riluce;
vedi lâerbette, i fiori e li arbuscelli
che qui la terra sol da sÃ© produce.

Mentre che vegnan lieti li occhi belli
che, lagrimando, a te venir mi fenno,
seder ti puoi e puoi andar tra elli.

Non aspettar mio dir piÃ¹ nÃ© mio cenno;
libero, dritto e sano Ã¨ tuo arbitrio,
e fallo fora non fare a suo senno:

per châio te sovra te corono e mitrioÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXVIII


Vago giÃ  di cercar dentro e dintorno
la divina foresta spessa e viva,
châa li occhi temperava il novo giorno,

sanza piÃ¹ aspettar, lasciai la riva,
prendendo la campagna lento lento
su per lo suol che dâogne parte auliva.

Unâaura dolce, sanza mutamento
avere in sÃ©, mi feria per la fronte
non di piÃ¹ colpo che soave vento;

per cui le fronde, tremolando, pronte
tutte quante piegavano a la parte
uâ la primâ ombra gitta il santo monte;

non perÃ² dal loro esser dritto sparte
tanto, che li augelletti per le cime
lasciasser dâoperare ogne lor arte;

ma con piena letizia lâore prime,
cantando, ricevieno intra le foglie,
che tenevan bordone a le sue rime,

tal qual di ramo in ramo si raccoglie
per la pineta in su âl lito di Chiassi,
quandâ Ãolo scilocco fuor discioglie.

GiÃ  mâavean trasportato i lenti passi
dentro a la selva antica tanto, châio
non potea rivedere ondâ io mi ântrassi;

ed ecco piÃ¹ andar mi tolse un rio,
che ânverâ sinistra con sue picciole onde
piegava lâerba che ân sua ripa uscÃ¬o.

Tutte lâacque che son di qua piÃ¹ monde,
parrieno avere in sÃ© mistura alcuna
verso di quella, che nulla nasconde,

avvegna che si mova bruna bruna
sotto lâombra perpetÃ¼a, che mai
raggiar non lascia sole ivi nÃ© luna.

Coi piÃ¨ ristetti e con li occhi passai
di lÃ  dal fiumicello, per mirare
la gran varÃ¯azion dâi freschi mai;

e lÃ  mâapparve, sÃ¬ comâ elli appare
subitamente cosa che disvia
per maraviglia tutto altro pensare,

una donna soletta che si gia
e cantando e scegliendo fior da fiore
ondâ era pinta tutta la sua via.

Â«Deh, bella donna, che aâ raggi dâamore
ti scaldi, sâiâ voâ credere aâ sembianti
che soglion esser testimon del core,

vegnati in voglia di trarreti avantiÂ»,
dissâ io a lei, Â«verso questa rivera,
tanto châio possa intender che tu canti.

Tu mi fai rimembrar dove e qual era
Proserpina nel tempo che perdette
la madre lei, ed ella primaveraÂ».

Come si volge, con le piante strette
a terra e intra sÃ©, donna che balli,
e piede innanzi piede a pena mette,

volsesi in su i vermigli e in su i gialli
fioretti verso me, non altrimenti
che vergine che li occhi onesti avvalli;

e fece i prieghi miei esser contenti,
sÃ¬ appressando sÃ©, che âl dolce suono
veniva a me coâ suoi intendimenti.

Tosto che fu lÃ  dove lâerbe sono
bagnate giÃ  da lâonde del bel fiume,
di levar li occhi suoi mi fece dono.

Non credo che splendesse tanto lume
sotto le ciglia a Venere, trafitta
dal figlio fuor di tutto suo costume.

Ella ridea da lâaltra riva dritta,
trattando piÃ¹ color con le sue mani,
che lâalta terra sanza seme gitta.

Tre passi ci facea il fiume lontani;
ma Elesponto, lÃ  âve passÃ² Serse,
ancora freno a tutti orgogli umani,

piÃ¹ odio da Leandro non sofferse
per mareggiare intra Sesto e Abido,
che quel da me perchâ allor non sâaperse.

Â«Voi siete nuovi, e forse perchâ io ridoÂ»,
cominciÃ² ella, Â«in questo luogo eletto
a lâumana natura per suo nido,

maravigliando tienvi alcun sospetto;
ma luce rende il salmo Delectasti,
che puote disnebbiar vostro intelletto.

E tu che seâ dinanzi e mi pregasti,
dÃ¬ sâaltro vuoli udir; châiâ venni presta
ad ogne tua question tanto che bastiÂ».

Â«LâacquaÂ», dissâ io, Â«e âl suon de la foresta
impugnan dentro a me novella fede
di cosa châio udiâ contraria a questaÂ».

Ondâ ella: Â«Io dicerÃ² come procede
per sua cagion ciÃ² châammirar ti face,
e purgherÃ² la nebbia che ti fiede.

Lo sommo Ben, che solo esso a sÃ© piace,
fÃ© lâuom buono e a bene, e questo loco
diede per arrâ a lui dâetterna pace.

Per sua difalta qui dimorÃ² poco;
per sua difalta in pianto e in affanno
cambiÃ² onesto riso e dolce gioco.

PerchÃ© âl turbar che sotto da sÃ© fanno
lâessalazion de lâacqua e de la terra,
che quanto posson dietro al calor vanno,

a lâuomo non facesse alcuna guerra,
questo monte salÃ¬o verso âl ciel tanto,
e libero nâÃ¨ dâindi ove si serra.

Or perchÃ© in circuito tutto quanto
lâaere si volge con la prima volta,
se non li Ã¨ rotto il cerchio dâalcun canto,

in questa altezza châÃ¨ tutta disciolta
ne lâaere vivo, tal moto percuote,
e fa sonar la selva perchâ Ã¨ folta;

e la percossa pianta tanto puote,
che de la sua virtute lâaura impregna
e quella poi, girando, intorno scuote;

e lâaltra terra, secondo châÃ¨ degna
per sÃ© e per suo ciel, concepe e figlia
di diverse virtÃ¹ diverse legna.

Non parrebbe di lÃ  poi maraviglia,
udito questo, quando alcuna pianta
sanza seme palese vi sâappiglia.

E saper dei che la campagna santa
dove tu seâ, dâogne semenza Ã¨ piena,
e frutto ha in sÃ© che di lÃ  non si schianta.

Lâacqua che vedi non surge di vena
che ristori vapor che gel converta,
come fiume châacquista e perde lena;

ma esce di fontana salda e certa,
che tanto dal voler di Dio riprende,
quantâ ella versa da due parti aperta.

Da questa parte con virtÃ¹ discende
che toglie altrui memoria del peccato;
da lâaltra dâogne ben fatto la rende.

Quinci LetÃ¨; cosÃ¬ da lâaltro lato
EÃ¼noÃ¨ si chiama, e non adopra
se quinci e quindi pria non Ã¨ gustato:

a tutti altri sapori esto Ã¨ di sopra.
E avvegna châassai possa esser sazia
la sete tua perchâ io piÃ¹ non ti scuopra,

darotti un corollario ancor per grazia;
nÃ© credo che âl mio dir ti sia men caro,
se oltre promession teco si spazia.

Quelli châanticamente poetaro
lâetÃ  de lâoro e suo stato felice,
forse in Parnaso esto loco sognaro.

Qui fu innocente lâumana radice;
qui primavera sempre e ogne frutto;
nettare Ã¨ questo di che ciascun diceÂ».

Io mi rivolsi ân dietro allora tutto
aâ miei poeti, e vidi che con riso
udito avÃ«an lâultimo costrutto;

poi a la bella donna tornaâ il viso.



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXIX


Cantando come donna innamorata,
continÃ¼Ã² col fin di sue parole:
âBeati quorum tecta sunt peccata!â.

E come ninfe che si givan sole
per le salvatiche ombre, disÃ¯ando
qual di veder, qual di fuggir lo sole,

allor si mosse contra âl fiume, andando
su per la riva; e io pari di lei,
picciol passo con picciol seguitando.

Non eran cento tra â suoi passi e â miei,
quando le ripe igualmente dier volta,
per modo châa levante mi rendei.

NÃ© ancor fu cosÃ¬ nostra via molta,
quando la donna tutta a me si torse,
dicendo: Â«Frate mio, guarda e ascoltaÂ».

Ed ecco un lustro sÃ¹bito trascorse
da tutte parti per la gran foresta,
tal che di balenar mi mise in forse.

Ma perchÃ© âl balenar, come vien, resta,
e quel, durando, piÃ¹ e piÃ¹ splendeva,
nel mio pensier dicea: âChe cosa Ã¨ questa?â.

E una melodia dolce correva
per lâaere luminoso; onde buon zelo
mi fÃ© riprender lâardimento dâEva,

che lÃ  dove ubidia la terra e âl cielo,
femmina, sola e pur testÃ© formata,
non sofferse di star sotto alcun velo;

sotto âl qual se divota fosse stata,
avrei quelle ineffabili delizie
sentite prima e piÃ¹ lunga fÃ¯ata.

Mentrâ io mâandava tra tante primizie
de lâetterno piacer tutto sospeso,
e disÃ¯oso ancora a piÃ¹ letizie,

dinanzi a noi, tal quale un foco acceso,
ci si fÃ© lâaere sotto i verdi rami;
e âl dolce suon per canti era giÃ  inteso.

O sacrosante Vergini, se fami,
freddi o vigilie mai per voi soffersi,
cagion mi sprona châio mercÃ© vi chiami.

Or convien che Elicona per me versi,
e UranÃ¬e mâaiuti col suo coro
forti cose a pensar mettere in versi.

Poco piÃ¹ oltre, sette alberi dâoro
falsava nel parere il lungo tratto
del mezzo châera ancor tra noi e loro;

ma quandâ iâ fui sÃ¬ presso di lor fatto,
che lâobietto comun, che âl senso inganna,
non perdea per distanza alcun suo atto,

la virtÃ¹ châa ragion discorso ammanna,
sÃ¬ comâ elli eran candelabri apprese,
e ne le voci del cantare âOsannaâ.

Di sopra fiammeggiava il bello arnese
piÃ¹ chiaro assai che luna per sereno
di mezza notte nel suo mezzo mese.

Io mi rivolsi dâammirazion pieno
al buon Virgilio, ed esso mi rispuose
con vista carca di stupor non meno.

Indi rendei lâaspetto a lâalte cose
che si movieno incontrâ a noi sÃ¬ tardi,
che foran vinte da novelle spose.

La donna mi sgridÃ²: Â«PerchÃ© pur ardi
sÃ¬ ne lâaffetto de le vive luci,
e ciÃ² che vien di retro a lor non guardi?Â».

Genti vidâ io allor, come a lor duci,
venire appresso, vestite di bianco;
e tal candor di qua giÃ  mai non fuci.

Lâacqua imprendÃ«a dal sinistro fianco,
e rendea me la mia sinistra costa,
sâio riguardava in lei, come specchio anco.

Quandâ io da la mia riva ebbi tal posta,
che solo il fiume mi facea distante,
per veder meglio ai passi diedi sosta,

e vidi le fiammelle andar davante,
lasciando dietro a sÃ© lâaere dipinto,
e di tratti pennelli avean sembiante;

sÃ¬ che lÃ¬ sopra rimanea distinto
di sette liste, tutte in quei colori
onde fa lâarco il Sole e Delia il cinto.

Questi ostendali in dietro eran maggiori
che la mia vista; e, quanto a mio avviso,
diece passi distavan quei di fori.

Sotto cosÃ¬ bel ciel comâ io diviso,
ventiquattro seniori, a due a due,
coronati venien di fiordaliso.

Tutti cantavan: Â«Benedicta tue
ne le figlie dâAdamo, e benedette
sieno in etterno le bellezze tue!Â».

Poscia che i fiori e lâaltre fresche erbette
a rimpetto di me da lâaltra sponda
libere fuor da quelle genti elette,

sÃ¬ come luce luce in ciel seconda,
vennero appresso lor quattro animali,
coronati ciascun di verde fronda.

Ognuno era pennuto di sei ali;
le penne piene dâocchi; e li occhi dâArgo,
se fosser vivi, sarebber cotali.

A descriver lor forme piÃ¹ non spargo
rime, lettor; châaltra spesa mi strigne,
tanto châa questa non posso esser largo;

ma leggi EzechÃ¯el, che li dipigne
come li vide da la fredda parte
venir con vento e con nube e con igne;

e quali i troverai ne le sue carte,
tali eran quivi, salvo châa le penne
Giovanni Ã¨ meco e da lui si diparte.

Lo spazio dentro a lor quattro contenne
un carro, in su due rote, trÃ¯unfale,
châal collo dâun grifon tirato venne.

Esso tendeva in sÃ¹ lâuna e lâaltra ale
tra la mezzana e le tre e tre liste,
sÃ¬ châa nulla, fendendo, facea male.

Tanto salivan che non eran viste;
le membra dâoro avea quantâ era uccello,
e bianche lâaltre, di vermiglio miste.

Non che Roma di carro cosÃ¬ bello
rallegrasse Affricano, o vero Augusto,
ma quel del Sol saria pover con ello;

quel del Sol che, svÃ¯ando, fu combusto
per lâorazion de la Terra devota,
quando fu Giove arcanamente giusto.

Tre donne in giro da la destra rota
venian danzando; lâuna tanto rossa
châa pena fora dentro al foco nota;

lâaltrâ era come se le carni e lâossa
fossero state di smeraldo fatte;
la terza parea neve testÃ© mossa;

e or parÃ«an da la bianca tratte,
or da la rossa; e dal canto di questa
lâaltre toglien lâandare e tarde e ratte.

Da la sinistra quattro facean festa,
in porpore vestite, dietro al modo
dâuna di lor châavea tre occhi in testa.

Appresso tutto il pertrattato nodo
vidi due vecchi in abito dispari,
ma pari in atto e onesto e sodo.

Lâun si mostrava alcun deâ famigliari
di quel sommo IpocrÃ te che natura
a li animali fÃ© châellâ ha piÃ¹ cari;

mostrava lâaltro la contraria cura
con una spada lucida e aguta,
tal che di qua dal rio mi fÃ© paura.

Poi vidi quattro in umile paruta;
e di retro da tutti un vecchio solo
venir, dormendo, con la faccia arguta.

E questi sette col primaio stuolo
erano abitÃ¼ati, ma di gigli
dintorno al capo non facÃ«an brolo,

anzi di rose e dâaltri fior vermigli;
giurato avria poco lontano aspetto
che tutti ardesser di sopra daâ cigli.

E quando il carro a me fu a rimpetto,
un tuon sâudÃ¬, e quelle genti degne
parvero aver lâandar piÃ¹ interdetto,

fermandosi ivi con le prime insegne.



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXX


Quando il settentrÃ¯on del primo cielo,
che nÃ© occaso mai seppe nÃ© orto
nÃ© dâaltra nebbia che di colpa velo,

e che faceva lÃ¬ ciascun accorto
di suo dover, come âl piÃ¹ basso face
qual temon gira per venire a porto,

fermo sâaffisse: la gente verace,
venuta prima tra âl grifone ed esso,
al carro volse sÃ© come a sua pace;

e un di loro, quasi da ciel messo,
âVeni, sponsa, de Libanoâ cantando
gridÃ² tre volte, e tutti li altri appresso.

Quali i beati al novissimo bando
surgeran presti ognun di sua caverna,
la revestita voce alleluiando,

cotali in su la divina basterna
si levar cento, ad vocem tanti senis,
ministri e messaggier di vita etterna.

Tutti dicean: âBenedictus qui venis!â,
e fior gittando e di sopra e dintorno,
âManibus, oh, date lilÃ¯a plenis!â.

Io vidi giÃ  nel cominciar del giorno
la parte orÃ¯ental tutta rosata,
e lâaltro ciel di bel sereno addorno;

e la faccia del sol nascere ombrata,
sÃ¬ che per temperanza di vapori
lâocchio la sostenea lunga fÃ¯ata:

cosÃ¬ dentro una nuvola di fiori
che da le mani angeliche saliva
e ricadeva in giÃ¹ dentro e di fori,

sovra candido vel cinta dâuliva
donna mâapparve, sotto verde manto
vestita di color di fiamma viva.

E lo spirito mio, che giÃ  cotanto
tempo era stato châa la sua presenza
non era di stupor, tremando, affranto,

sanza de li occhi aver piÃ¹ conoscenza,
per occulta virtÃ¹ che da lei mosse,
dâantico amor sentÃ¬ la gran potenza.

Tosto che ne la vista mi percosse
lâalta virtÃ¹ che giÃ  mâavea trafitto
prima châio fuor di pÃ¼erizia fosse,

volsimi a la sinistra col respitto
col quale il fantolin corre a la mamma
quando ha paura o quando elli Ã¨ afflitto,

per dicere a Virgilio: âMen che dramma
di sangue mâÃ¨ rimaso che non tremi:
conosco i segni de lâantica fiammaâ.

Ma Virgilio nâavea lasciati scemi
di sÃ©, Virgilio dolcissimo patre,
Virgilio a cui per mia salute dieâmi;

nÃ© quantunque perdeo lâantica matre,
valse a le guance nette di rugiada,
che, lagrimando, non tornasser atre.

Â«Dante, perchÃ© Virgilio se ne vada,
non pianger anco, non piangere ancora;
chÃ© pianger ti conven per altra spadaÂ».

Quasi ammiraglio che in poppa e in prora
viene a veder la gente che ministra
per li altri legni, e a ben far lâincora;

in su la sponda del carro sinistra,
quando mi volsi al suon del nome mio,
che di necessitÃ  qui si registra,

vidi la donna che pria mâappario
velata sotto lâangelica festa,
drizzar li occhi verâ me di qua dal rio.

Tutto che âl vel che le scendea di testa,
cerchiato de le fronde di Minerva,
non la lasciasse parer manifesta,

regalmente ne lâatto ancor proterva
continÃ¼Ã² come colui che dice
e âl piÃ¹ caldo parlar dietro reserva:

Â«Guardaci ben! Ben son, ben son Beatrice.
Come degnasti dâaccedere al monte?
non sapei tu che qui Ã¨ lâuom felice?Â».

Li occhi mi cadder giÃ¹ nel chiaro fonte;
ma veggendomi in esso, i trassi a lâerba,
tanta vergogna mi gravÃ² la fronte.

CosÃ¬ la madre al figlio par superba,
comâ ella parve a me; perchÃ© dâamaro
sente il sapor de la pietade acerba.

Ella si tacque; e li angeli cantaro
di sÃ¹bito âIn te, Domine, speraviâ;
ma oltre âpedes meosâ non passaro.

SÃ¬ come neve tra le vive travi
per lo dosso dâItalia si congela,
soffiata e stretta da li venti schiavi,

poi, liquefatta, in sÃ© stessa trapela,
pur che la terra che perde ombra spiri,
sÃ¬ che par foco fonder la candela;

cosÃ¬ fui sanza lagrime e sospiri
anzi âl cantar di quei che notan sempre
dietro a le note de li etterni giri;

ma poi che ântesi ne le dolci tempre
lor compatire a me, par che se detto
avesser: âDonna, perchÃ© sÃ¬ lo stempre?â,

lo gel che mâera intorno al cor ristretto,
spirito e acqua fessi, e con angoscia
de la bocca e de li occhi uscÃ¬ del petto.

Ella, pur ferma in su la detta coscia
del carro stando, a le sustanze pie
volse le sue parole cosÃ¬ poscia:

Â«Voi vigilate ne lâetterno die,
sÃ¬ che notte nÃ© sonno a voi non fura
passo che faccia il secol per sue vie;

onde la mia risposta Ã¨ con piÃ¹ cura
che mâintenda colui che di lÃ  piagne,
perchÃ© sia colpa e duol dâuna misura.

Non pur per ovra de le rote magne,
che drizzan ciascun seme ad alcun fine
secondo che le stelle son compagne,

ma per larghezza di grazie divine,
che sÃ¬ alti vapori hanno a lor piova,
che nostre viste lÃ  non van vicine,

questi fu tal ne la sua vita nova
virtÃ¼almente, châogne abito destro
fatto averebbe in lui mirabil prova.

Ma tanto piÃ¹ maligno e piÃ¹ silvestro
si fa âl terren col mal seme e non cÃ³lto,
quantâ elli ha piÃ¹ di buon vigor terrestro.

Alcun tempo il sostenni col mio volto:
mostrando li occhi giovanetti a lui,
meco il menava in dritta parte vÃ²lto.

SÃ¬ tosto come in su la soglia fui
di mia seconda etade e mutai vita,
questi si tolse a me, e diessi altrui.

Quando di carne a spirto era salita,
e bellezza e virtÃ¹ cresciuta mâera,
fuâ io a lui men cara e men gradita;

e volse i passi suoi per via non vera,
imagini di ben seguendo false,
che nulla promession rendono intera.

NÃ© lâimpetrare ispirazion mi valse,
con le quali e in sogno e altrimenti
lo rivocai: sÃ¬ poco a lui ne calse!

Tanto giÃ¹ cadde, che tutti argomenti
a la salute sua eran giÃ  corti,
fuor che mostrarli le perdute genti.

Per questo visitai lâuscio dâi morti,
e a colui che lâha qua sÃ¹ condotto,
li prieghi miei, piangendo, furon porti.

Alto fato di Dio sarebbe rotto,
se LetÃ¨ si passasse e tal vivanda
fosse gustata sanza alcuno scotto

di pentimento che lagrime spandaÂ».



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXXI


Â«O tu che seâ di lÃ  dal fiume sacroÂ»,
volgendo suo parlare a me per punta,
che pur per taglio mâera paruto acro,

ricominciÃ², seguendo sanza cunta,
Â«dÃ¬, dÃ¬ se questo Ã¨ vero: a tanta accusa
tua confession conviene esser congiuntaÂ».

Era la mia virtÃ¹ tanto confusa,
che la voce si mosse, e pria si spense
che da li organi suoi fosse dischiusa.

Poco sofferse; poi disse: Â«Che pense?
Rispondi a me; chÃ© le memorie triste
in te non sono ancor da lâacqua offenseÂ».

Confusione e paura insieme miste
mi pinsero un tal Â«sÃ¬Â» fuor de la bocca,
al quale intender fuor mestier le viste.

Come balestro frange, quando scocca
da troppa tesa, la sua corda e lâarco,
e con men foga lâasta il segno tocca,

sÃ¬ scoppiaâ io sottesso grave carco,
fuori sgorgando lagrime e sospiri,
e la voce allentÃ² per lo suo varco.

Ondâ ella a me: Â«Per entro i mieâ disiri,
che ti menavano ad amar lo bene
di lÃ  dal qual non Ã¨ a che sâaspiri,

quai fossi attraversati o quai catene
trovasti, per che del passare innanzi
dovessiti cosÃ¬ spogliar la spene?

E quali agevolezze o quali avanzi
ne la fronte de li altri si mostraro,
per che dovessi lor passeggiare anzi?Â».

Dopo la tratta dâun sospiro amaro,
a pena ebbi la voce che rispuose,
e le labbra a fatica la formaro.

Piangendo dissi: Â«Le presenti cose
col falso lor piacer volser miei passi,
tosto che âl vostro viso si nascoseÂ».

Ed ella: Â«Se tacessi o se negassi
ciÃ² che confessi, non fora men nota
la colpa tua: da tal giudice sassi!

Ma quando scoppia de la propria gota
lâaccusa del peccato, in nostra corte
rivolge sÃ© contra âl taglio la rota.

Tuttavia, perchÃ© mo vergogna porte
del tuo errore, e perchÃ© altra volta,
udendo le serene, sie piÃ¹ forte,

pon giÃ¹ il seme del piangere e ascolta:
sÃ¬ udirai come in contraria parte
mover dovieti mia carne sepolta.

Mai non tâappresentÃ² natura o arte
piacer, quanto le belle membra in châio
rinchiusa fui, e che soâ ân terra sparte;

e se âl sommo piacer sÃ¬ ti fallio
per la mia morte, qual cosa mortale
dovea poi trarre te nel suo disio?

Ben ti dovevi, per lo primo strale
de le cose fallaci, levar suso
di retro a me che non era piÃ¹ tale.

Non ti dovea gravar le penne in giuso,
ad aspettar piÃ¹ colpo, o pargoletta
o altra novitÃ  con sÃ¬ breve uso.

Novo augelletto due o tre aspetta;
ma dinanzi da li occhi dâi pennuti
rete si spiega indarno o si saettaÂ».

Quali fanciulli, vergognando, muti
con li occhi a terra stannosi, ascoltando
e sÃ© riconoscendo e ripentuti,

tal mi stavâ io; ed ella disse: Â«Quando
per udir seâ dolente, alza la barba,
e prenderai piÃ¹ doglia riguardandoÂ».

Con men di resistenza si dibarba
robusto cerro, o vero al nostral vento
o vero a quel de la terra di Iarba,

châio non levai al suo comando il mento;
e quando per la barba il viso chiese,
ben conobbi il velen de lâargomento.

E come la mia faccia si distese,
posarsi quelle prime creature
da loro aspersÃ¯on lâocchio comprese;

e le mie luci, ancor poco sicure,
vider Beatrice volta in su la fiera
châÃ¨ sola una persona in due nature.

Sotto âl suo velo e oltre la rivera
vincer pariemi piÃ¹ sÃ© stessa antica,
vincer che lâaltre qui, quandâ ella câera.

Di penter sÃ¬ mi punse ivi lâortica,
che di tutte altre cose qual mi torse
piÃ¹ nel suo amor, piÃ¹ mi si fÃ© nemica.

Tanta riconoscenza il cor mi morse,
châio caddi vinto; e quale allora femmi,
salsi colei che la cagion mi porse.

Poi, quando il cor virtÃ¹ di fuor rendemmi,
la donna châio avea trovata sola
sopra me vidi, e dicea: Â«Tiemmi, tiemmi!Â».

Tratto mâavea nel fiume infin la gola,
e tirandosi me dietro sen giva
sovresso lâacqua lieve come scola.

Quando fui presso a la beata riva,
âAsperges meâ sÃ¬ dolcemente udissi,
che nol so rimembrar, non châio lo scriva.

La bella donna ne le braccia aprissi;
abbracciommi la testa e mi sommerse
ove convenne châio lâacqua inghiottissi.

Indi mi tolse, e bagnato mâofferse
dentro a la danza de le quattro belle;
e ciascuna del braccio mi coperse.

Â«Noi siam qui ninfe e nel ciel siamo stelle;
pria che Beatrice discendesse al mondo,
fummo ordinate a lei per sue ancelle.

Merrenti a li occhi suoi; ma nel giocondo
lume châÃ¨ dentro aguzzeranno i tuoi
le tre di lÃ , che miran piÃ¹ profondoÂ».

CosÃ¬ cantando cominciaro; e poi
al petto del grifon seco menarmi,
ove Beatrice stava volta a noi.

Disser: Â«Fa che le viste non risparmi;
posto tâavem dinanzi a li smeraldi
ondâ Amor giÃ  ti trasse le sue armiÂ».

Mille disiri piÃ¹ che fiamma caldi
strinsermi li occhi a li occhi rilucenti,
che pur sopra âl grifone stavan saldi.

Come in lo specchio il sol, non altrimenti
la doppia fiera dentro vi raggiava,
or con altri, or con altri reggimenti.

Pensa, lettor, sâio mi maravigliava,
quando vedea la cosa in sÃ© star queta,
e ne lâidolo suo si trasmutava.

Mentre che piena di stupore e lieta
lâanima mia gustava di quel cibo
che, saziando di sÃ©, di sÃ© asseta,

sÃ© dimostrando di piÃ¹ alto tribo
ne li atti, lâaltre tre si fero avanti,
danzando al loro angelico caribo.

Â«Volgi, Beatrice, volgi li occhi santiÂ»,
era la sua canzone, Â«al tuo fedele
che, per vederti, ha mossi passi tanti!

Per grazia fa noi grazia che disvele
a lui la bocca tua, sÃ¬ che discerna
la seconda bellezza che tu celeÂ».

O isplendor di viva luce etterna,
chi palido si fece sotto lâombra
sÃ¬ di Parnaso, o bevve in sua cisterna,

che non paresse aver la mente ingombra,
tentando a render te qual tu paresti
lÃ  dove armonizzando il ciel tâadombra,

quando ne lâaere aperto ti solvesti?



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXXII


Tantâ eran li occhi miei fissi e attenti
a disbramarsi la decenne sete,
che li altri sensi mâeran tutti spenti.

Ed essi quinci e quindi avien parete
di non calerâcosÃ¬ lo santo riso
a sÃ© traÃ©li con lâantica rete!â;

quando per forza mi fu vÃ²lto il viso
verâ la sinistra mia da quelle dee,
perchâ io udiâ da loro un Â«Troppo fiso!Â»;

e la disposizion châa veder Ã¨e
ne li occhi pur testÃ© dal sol percossi,
sanza la vista alquanto esser mi fÃ©e.

Ma poi châal poco il viso riformossi
(e dico âal pocoâ per rispetto al molto
sensibile onde a forza mi rimossi),

vidi ân sul braccio destro esser rivolto
lo glorÃ¯oso essercito, e tornarsi
col sole e con le sette fiamme al volto.

Come sotto li scudi per salvarsi
volgesi schiera, e sÃ© gira col segno,
prima che possa tutta in sÃ© mutarsi;

quella milizia del celeste regno
che procedeva, tutta trapassonne
pria che piegasse il carro il primo legno.

Indi a le rote si tornar le donne,
e âl grifon mosse il benedetto carco
sÃ¬, che perÃ² nulla penna crollonne.

La bella donna che mi trasse al varco
e Stazio e io seguitavam la rota
che fÃ© lâorbita sua con minore arco.

SÃ¬ passeggiando lâalta selva vÃ²ta,
colpa di quella châal serpente crese,
temprava i passi unâangelica nota.

Forse in tre voli tanto spazio prese
disfrenata saetta, quanto eramo
rimossi, quando BÃ«atrice scese.

Io sentiâ mormorare a tutti Â«AdamoÂ»;
poi cerchiaro una pianta dispogliata
di foglie e dâaltra fronda in ciascun ramo.

La coma sua, che tanto si dilata
piÃ¹ quanto piÃ¹ Ã¨ sÃ¹, fora da lâIndi
neâ boschi lor per altezza ammirata.

Â«Beato seâ, grifon, che non discindi
col becco dâesto legno dolce al gusto,
poscia che mal si torce il ventre quindiÂ».

CosÃ¬ dintorno a lâalbero robusto
gridaron li altri; e lâanimal binato:
Â«SÃ¬ si conserva il seme dâogne giustoÂ».

E vÃ²lto al temo châelli avea tirato,
trasselo al piÃ¨ de la vedova frasca,
e quel di lei a lei lasciÃ² legato.

Come le nostre piante, quando casca
giÃ¹ la gran luce mischiata con quella
che raggia dietro a la celeste lasca,

turgide fansi, e poi si rinovella
di suo color ciascuna, pria che âl sole
giunga li suoi corsier sotto altra stella;

men che di rose e piÃ¹ che di vÃ¯ole
colore aprendo, sâinnovÃ² la pianta,
che prima avea le ramora sÃ¬ sole.

Io non lo ântesi, nÃ© qui non si canta
lâinno che quella gente allor cantaro,
nÃ© la nota soffersi tutta quanta.

Sâio potessi ritrar come assonnaro
li occhi spietati udendo di Siringa,
li occhi a cui pur vegghiar costÃ² sÃ¬ caro;

come pintor che con essempro pinga,
disegnerei comâ io mâaddormentai;
ma qual vuol sia che lâassonnar ben finga.

PerÃ² trascorro a quando mi svegliai,
e dico châun splendor mi squarciÃ² âl velo
del sonno, e un chiamar: Â«Surgi: che fai?Â».

Quali a veder deâ fioretti del melo
che del suo pome li angeli fa ghiotti
e perpetÃ¼e nozze fa nel cielo,

Pietro e Giovanni e Iacopo condotti
e vinti, ritornaro a la parola
da la qual furon maggior sonni rotti,

e videro scemata loro scuola
cosÃ¬ di MoÃ¯sÃ¨ come dâElia,
e al maestro suo cangiata stola;

tal tornaâ io, e vidi quella pia
sovra me starsi che conducitrice
fu deâ miei passi lungo âl fiume pria.

E tutto in dubbio dissi: Â«Ovâ Ã¨ Beatrice?Â».
Ondâ ella: Â«Vedi lei sotto la fronda
nova sedere in su la sua radice.

Vedi la compagnia che la circonda:
li altri dopo âl grifon sen vanno suso
con piÃ¹ dolce canzone e piÃ¹ profondaÂ».

E se piÃ¹ fu lo suo parlar diffuso,
non so, perÃ² che giÃ  ne li occhi mâera
quella châad altro intender mâavea chiuso.

Sola sedeasi in su la terra vera,
come guardia lasciata lÃ¬ del plaustro
che legar vidi a la biforme fera.

In cerchio le facevan di sÃ© claustro
le sette ninfe, con quei lumi in mano
che son sicuri dâAquilone e dâAustro.

Â«Qui sarai tu poco tempo silvano;
e sarai meco sanza fine cive
di quella Roma onde Cristo Ã¨ romano.

PerÃ², in pro del mondo che mal vive,
al carro tieni or li occhi, e quel che vedi,
ritornato di lÃ , fa che tu scriveÂ».

CosÃ¬ Beatrice; e io, che tutto ai piedi
dâi suoi comandamenti era divoto,
la mente e li occhi ovâ ella volle diedi.

Non scese mai con sÃ¬ veloce moto
foco di spessa nube, quando piove
da quel confine che piÃ¹ va remoto,

comâ io vidi calar lâuccel di Giove
per lâalber giÃ¹, rompendo de la scorza,
non che dâi fiori e de le foglie nove;

e ferÃ¬ âl carro di tutta sua forza;
ondâ el piegÃ² come nave in fortuna,
vinta da lâonda, or da poggia, or da orza.

Poscia vidi avventarsi ne la cuna
del trÃ¯unfal veiculo una volpe
che dâogne pasto buon parea digiuna;

ma, riprendendo lei di laide colpe,
la donna mia la volse in tanta futa
quanto sofferser lâossa sanza polpe.

Poscia per indi ondâ era pria venuta,
lâaguglia vidi scender giÃ¹ ne lâarca
del carro e lasciar lei di sÃ© pennuta;

e qual esce di cuor che si rammarca,
tal voce uscÃ¬ del cielo e cotal disse:
Â«O navicella mia, comâ mal seâ carca!Â».

Poi parve a me che la terra sâaprisse
trâambo le ruote, e vidi uscirne un drago
che per lo carro sÃ¹ la coda fisse;

e come vespa che ritragge lâago,
a sÃ© traendo la coda maligna,
trasse del fondo, e gissen vago vago.

Quel che rimase, come da gramigna
vivace terra, da la piuma, offerta
forse con intenzion sana e benigna,

si ricoperse, e funne ricoperta
e lâuna e lâaltra rota e âl temo, in tanto
che piÃ¹ tiene un sospir la bocca aperta.

Trasformato cosÃ¬ âl dificio santo
mise fuor teste per le parti sue,
tre sovra âl temo e una in ciascun canto.

Le prime eran cornute come bue,
ma le quattro un sol corno avean per fronte:
simile mostro visto ancor non fue.

Sicura, quasi rocca in alto monte,
seder sovresso una puttana sciolta
mâapparve con le ciglia intorno pronte;

e come perchÃ© non li fosse tolta,
vidi di costa a lei dritto un gigante;
e basciavansi insieme alcuna volta.

Ma perchÃ© lâocchio cupido e vagante
a me rivolse, quel feroce drudo
la flagellÃ² dal capo infin le piante;

poi, di sospetto pieno e dâira crudo,
disciolse il mostro, e trassel per la selva,
tanto che sol di lei mi fece scudo

a la puttana e a la nova belva.



Purgatorio Â· Canto XXXIII


âDeus, venerunt gentesâ, alternando
or tre or quattro dolce salmodia,
le donne incominciaro, e lagrimando;

e BÃ«atrice, sospirosa e pia,
quelle ascoltava sÃ¬ fatta, che poco
piÃ¹ a la croce si cambiÃ² Maria.

Ma poi che lâaltre vergini dier loco
a lei di dir, levata dritta in pÃ¨,
rispuose, colorata come foco:

âModicum, et non videbitis me;
et iterum, sorelle mie dilette,
modicum, et vos videbitis meâ.

Poi le si mise innanzi tutte e sette,
e dopo sÃ©, solo accennando, mosse
me e la donna e âl savio che ristette.

CosÃ¬ sen giva; e non credo che fosse
lo decimo suo passo in terra posto,
quando con li occhi li occhi mi percosse;

e con tranquillo aspetto Â«Vien piÃ¹ tostoÂ»,
mi disse, Â«tanto che, sâio parlo teco,
ad ascoltarmi tu sie ben dispostoÂ».

SÃ¬ comâ io fui, comâ io dovÃ«a, seco,
dissemi: Â«Frate, perchÃ© non tâattenti
a domandarmi omai venendo meco?Â».

Come a color che troppo reverenti
dinanzi a suo maggior parlando sono,
che non traggon la voce viva ai denti,

avvenne a me, che sanza intero suono
incominciai: Â«Madonna, mia bisogna
voi conoscete, e ciÃ² châad essa Ã¨ buonoÂ».

Ed ella a me: Â«Da tema e da vergogna
voglio che tu omai ti disviluppe,
sÃ¬ che non parli piÃ¹ comâ om che sogna.

Sappi che âl vaso che âl serpente ruppe,
fu e non Ã¨; ma chi nâha colpa, creda
che vendetta di Dio non teme suppe.

Non sarÃ  tutto tempo sanza reda
lâaguglia che lasciÃ² le penne al carro,
per che divenne mostro e poscia preda;

châio veggio certamente, e perÃ² il narro,
a darne tempo giÃ  stelle propinque,
secure dâognâ intoppo e dâogne sbarro,

nel quale un cinquecento diece e cinque,
messo di Dio, anciderÃ  la fuia
con quel gigante che con lei delinque.

E forse che la mia narrazion buia,
qual Temi e Sfinge, men ti persuade,
perchâ a lor modo lo ântelletto attuia;

ma tosto fier li fatti le Naiade,
che solveranno questo enigma forte
sanza danno di pecore o di biade.

Tu nota; e sÃ¬ come da me son porte,
cosÃ¬ queste parole segna aâ vivi
del viver châÃ¨ un correre a la morte.

E aggi a mente, quando tu le scrivi,
di non celar qual hai vista la pianta
châÃ¨ or due volte dirubata quivi.

Qualunque ruba quella o quella schianta,
con bestemmia di fatto offende a Dio,
che solo a lâuso suo la creÃ² santa.

Per morder quella, in pena e in disio
cinquemilia anni e piÃ¹ lâanima prima
bramÃ² colui che âl morso in sÃ© punio.

Dorme lo ângegno tuo, se non estima
per singular cagione esser eccelsa
lei tanto e sÃ¬ travolta ne la cima.

E se stati non fossero acqua dâElsa
li pensier vani intorno a la tua mente,
e âl piacer loro un Piramo a la gelsa,

per tante circostanze solamente
la giustizia di Dio, ne lâinterdetto,
conosceresti a lâarbor moralmente.

Ma perchâ io veggio te ne lo ântelletto
fatto di pietra e, impetrato, tinto,
sÃ¬ che tâabbaglia il lume del mio detto,

voglio anco, e se non scritto, almen dipinto,
che âl te ne porti dentro a te per quello
che si reca il bordon di palma cintoÂ».

E io: Â«SÃ¬ come cera da suggello,
che la figura impressa non trasmuta,
segnato Ã¨ or da voi lo mio cervello.

Ma perchÃ© tanto sovra mia veduta
vostra parola disÃ¯ata vola,
che piÃ¹ la perde quanto piÃ¹ sâaiuta?Â».

Â«PerchÃ© conoschiÂ», disse, Â«quella scuola
câhai seguitata, e veggi sua dottrina
come puÃ² seguitar la mia parola;

e veggi vostra via da la divina
distar cotanto, quanto si discorda
da terra il ciel che piÃ¹ alto festinaÂ».

Ondâ io rispuosi lei: Â«Non mi ricorda
châiâ stranÃ¯asse me giÃ  mai da voi,
nÃ© honne coscÃ¯enza che rimordaÂ».

Â«E se tu ricordar non te ne puoiÂ»,
sorridendo rispuose, Â«or ti rammenta
come bevesti di LetÃ¨ ancoi;

e se dal fummo foco sâargomenta,
cotesta oblivÃ¯on chiaro conchiude
colpa ne la tua voglia altrove attenta.

Veramente oramai saranno nude
le mie parole, quanto converrassi
quelle scovrire a la tua vista rudeÂ».

E piÃ¹ corusco e con piÃ¹ lenti passi
teneva il sole il cerchio di merigge,
che qua e lÃ , come li aspetti, fassi,

quando sâaffisser, sÃ¬ come sâaffigge
chi va dinanzi a gente per iscorta
se trova novitate o sue vestigge,

le sette donne al fin dâunâombra smorta,
qual sotto foglie verdi e rami nigri
sovra suoi freddi rivi lâalpe porta.

Dinanzi ad esse ÃufratÃ¨s e Tigri
veder mi parve uscir dâuna fontana,
e, quasi amici, dipartirsi pigri.

Â«O luce, o gloria de la gente umana,
che acqua Ã¨ questa che qui si dispiega
da un principio e sÃ© da sÃ© lontana?Â».

Per cotal priego detto mi fu: Â«Priega
Matelda che âl ti dicaÂ». E qui rispuose,
come fa chi da colpa si dislega,

la bella donna: Â«Questo e altre cose
dette li son per me; e son sicura
che lâacqua di LetÃ¨ non gliel nascoseÂ».

E BÃ«atrice: Â«Forse maggior cura,
che spesse volte la memoria priva,
fattâ ha la mente sua ne li occhi oscura.

Ma vedi EÃ¼noÃ¨ che lÃ  diriva:
menalo ad esso, e come tu seâ usa,
la tramortita sua virtÃ¹ ravvivaÂ».

Come anima gentil, che non fa scusa,
ma fa sua voglia de la voglia altrui
tosto che Ã¨ per segno fuor dischiusa;

cosÃ¬, poi che da essa preso fui,
la bella donna mossesi, e a Stazio
donnescamente disse: Â«Vien con luiÂ».

Sâio avessi, lettor, piÃ¹ lungo spazio
da scrivere, iâ pur cantereâ in parte
lo dolce ber che mai non mâavria sazio;

ma perchÃ© piene son tutte le carte
ordite a questa cantica seconda,
non mi lascia piÃ¹ ir lo fren de lâarte.

Io ritornai da la santissima onda
rifatto sÃ¬ come piante novelle
rinovellate di novella fronda,

puro e disposto a salire a le stelle.





PARADISO




Paradiso Â· Canto I


La gloria di colui che tutto move
per lâuniverso penetra, e risplende
in una parte piÃ¹ e meno altrove.

Nel ciel che piÃ¹ de la sua luce prende
fuâ io, e vidi cose che ridire
nÃ© sa nÃ© puÃ² chi di lÃ  sÃ¹ discende;

perchÃ© appressando sÃ© al suo disire,
nostro intelletto si profonda tanto,
che dietro la memoria non puÃ² ire.

Veramente quantâ io del regno santo
ne la mia mente potei far tesoro,
sarÃ  ora materia del mio canto.

O buono Appollo, a lâultimo lavoro
fammi del tuo valor sÃ¬ fatto vaso,
come dimandi a dar lâamato alloro.

Infino a qui lâun giogo di Parnaso
assai mi fu; ma or con amendue
mâÃ¨ uopo intrar ne lâaringo rimaso.

Entra nel petto mio, e spira tue
sÃ¬ come quando MarsÃ¯a traesti
de la vagina de le membra sue.

O divina virtÃ¹, se mi ti presti
tanto che lâombra del beato regno
segnata nel mio capo io manifesti,

vedraâmi al piÃ¨ del tuo diletto legno
venire, e coronarmi de le foglie
che la materia e tu mi farai degno.

SÃ¬ rade volte, padre, se ne coglie
per trÃ¯unfare o cesare o poeta,
colpa e vergogna de lâumane voglie,

che parturir letizia in su la lieta
delfica deÃ¯tÃ  dovria la fronda
peneia, quando alcun di sÃ© asseta.

Poca favilla gran fiamma seconda:
forse di retro a me con miglior voci
si pregherÃ  perchÃ© Cirra risponda.

Surge ai mortali per diverse foci
la lucerna del mondo; ma da quella
che quattro cerchi giugne con tre croci,

con miglior corso e con migliore stella
esce congiunta, e la mondana cera
piÃ¹ a suo modo tempera e suggella.

Fatto avea di lÃ  mane e di qua sera
tal foce, e quasi tutto era lÃ  bianco
quello emisperio, e lâaltra parte nera,

quando Beatrice in sul sinistro fianco
vidi rivolta e riguardar nel sole:
aguglia sÃ¬ non li sâaffisse unquanco.

E sÃ¬ come secondo raggio suole
uscir del primo e risalire in suso,
pur come pelegrin che tornar vuole,

cosÃ¬ de lâatto suo, per li occhi infuso
ne lâimagine mia, il mio si fece,
e fissi li occhi al sole oltre nostrâ uso.

Molto Ã¨ licito lÃ , che qui non lece
a le nostre virtÃ¹, mercÃ© del loco
fatto per proprio de lâumana spece.

Io nol soffersi molto, nÃ© sÃ¬ poco,
châio nol vedessi sfavillar dintorno,
comâ ferro che bogliente esce del foco;

e di sÃ¹bito parve giorno a giorno
essere aggiunto, come quei che puote
avesse il ciel dâun altro sole addorno.

Beatrice tutta ne lâetterne rote
fissa con li occhi stava; e io in lei
le luci fissi, di lÃ  sÃ¹ rimote.

Nel suo aspetto tal dentro mi fei,
qual si fÃ© Glauco nel gustar de lâerba
che âl fÃ© consorto in mar de li altri dÃ¨i.

Trasumanar significar per verba
non si poria; perÃ² lâessemplo basti
a cui esperÃ¯enza grazia serba.

Sâiâ era sol di me quel che creasti
novellamente, amor che âl ciel governi,
tu âl sai, che col tuo lume mi levasti.

Quando la rota che tu sempiterni
desiderato, a sÃ© mi fece atteso
con lâarmonia che temperi e discerni,

parvemi tanto allor del cielo acceso
de la fiamma del sol, che pioggia o fiume
lago non fece alcun tanto disteso.

La novitÃ  del suono e âl grande lume
di lor cagion mâaccesero un disio
mai non sentito di cotanto acume.

Ondâ ella, che vedea me sÃ¬ comâ io,
a quÃ¯etarmi lâanimo commosso,
pria châio a dimandar, la bocca aprio

e cominciÃ²: Â«Tu stesso ti fai grosso
col falso imaginar, sÃ¬ che non vedi
ciÃ² che vedresti se lâavessi scosso.

Tu non seâ in terra, sÃ¬ come tu credi;
ma folgore, fuggendo il proprio sito,
non corse come tu châad esso riediÂ».

Sâio fui del primo dubbio disvestito
per le sorrise parolette brevi,
dentro ad un nuovo piÃ¹ fuâ inretito

e dissi: Â«GiÃ  contento requÃ¯evi
di grande ammirazion; ma ora ammiro
comâ io trascenda questi corpi leviÂ».

Ondâ ella, appresso dâun pÃ¯o sospiro,
li occhi drizzÃ² verâ me con quel sembiante
che madre fa sovra figlio deliro,

e cominciÃ²: Â«Le cose tutte quante
hanno ordine tra loro, e questo Ã¨ forma
che lâuniverso a Dio fa simigliante.

Qui veggion lâalte creature lâorma
de lâetterno valore, il qual Ã¨ fine
al quale Ã¨ fatta la toccata norma.

Ne lâordine châio dico sono accline
tutte nature, per diverse sorti,
piÃ¹ al principio loro e men vicine;

onde si muovono a diversi porti
per lo gran mar de lâessere, e ciascuna
con istinto a lei dato che la porti.

Questi ne porta il foco inverâ la luna;
questi neâ cor mortali Ã¨ permotore;
questi la terra in sÃ© stringe e aduna;

nÃ© pur le creature che son fore
dâintelligenza questâ arco saetta,
ma quelle câhanno intelletto e amore.

La provedenza, che cotanto assetta,
del suo lume fa âl ciel sempre quÃ¯eto
nel qual si volge quel câha maggior fretta;

e ora lÃ¬, come a sito decreto,
cen porta la virtÃ¹ di quella corda
che ciÃ² che scocca drizza in segno lieto.

Vero Ã¨ che, come forma non sâaccorda
molte fÃ¯ate a lâintenzion de lâarte,
perchâ a risponder la materia Ã¨ sorda,

cosÃ¬ da questo corso si diparte
talor la creatura, câha podere
di piegar, cosÃ¬ pinta, in altra parte;

e sÃ¬ come veder si puÃ² cadere
foco di nube, sÃ¬ lâimpeto primo
lâatterra torto da falso piacere.

Non dei piÃ¹ ammirar, se bene stimo,
lo tuo salir, se non come dâun rivo
se dâalto monte scende giuso ad imo.

Maraviglia sarebbe in te se, privo
dâimpedimento, giÃ¹ ti fossi assiso,
comâ a terra quÃ¯ete in foco vivoÂ».

Quinci rivolse inverâ lo cielo il viso.



Paradiso Â· Canto II


O voi che siete in piccioletta barca,
desiderosi dâascoltar, seguiti
dietro al mio legno che cantando varca,

tornate a riveder li vostri liti:
non vi mettete in pelago, chÃ© forse,
perdendo me, rimarreste smarriti.

Lâacqua châio prendo giÃ  mai non si corse;
Minerva spira, e conducemi Appollo,
e nove Muse mi dimostran lâOrse.

Voialtri pochi che drizzaste il collo
per tempo al pan de li angeli, del quale
vivesi qui ma non sen vien satollo,

metter potete ben per lâalto sale
vostro navigio, servando mio solco
dinanzi a lâacqua che ritorna equale.

Queâ glorÃ¯osi che passaro al Colco
non sâammiraron come voi farete,
quando IasÃ³n vider fatto bifolco.

La concreata e perpetÃ¼a sete
del deÃ¯forme regno cen portava
veloci quasi come âl ciel vedete.

Beatrice in suso, e io in lei guardava;
e forse in tanto in quanto un quadrel posa
e vola e da la noce si dischiava,

giunto mi vidi ove mirabil cosa
mi torse il viso a sÃ©; e perÃ² quella
cui non potea mia cura essere ascosa,

volta verâ me, sÃ¬ lieta come bella,
Â«Drizza la mente in Dio grataÂ», mi disse,
Â«che nâha congiunti con la prima stellaÂ».

Parevâ a me che nube ne coprisse
lucida, spessa, solida e pulita,
quasi adamante che lo sol ferisse.

Per entro sÃ© lâetterna margarita
ne ricevette, comâ acqua recepe
raggio di luce permanendo unita.

Sâio era corpo, e qui non si concepe
comâ una dimensione altra patio,
châesser convien se corpo in corpo repe,

accender ne dovria piÃ¹ il disio
di veder quella essenza in che si vede
come nostra natura e Dio sâunio.

LÃ¬ si vedrÃ  ciÃ² che tenem per fede,
non dimostrato, ma fia per sÃ© noto
a guisa del ver primo che lâuom crede.

Io rispuosi: Â«Madonna, sÃ¬ devoto
comâ esser posso piÃ¹, ringrazio lui
lo qual dal mortal mondo mâha remoto.

Ma ditemi: che son li segni bui
di questo corpo, che lÃ  giuso in terra
fan di Cain favoleggiare altrui?Â».

Ella sorrise alquanto, e poi Â«Sâelli erra
lâoppinÃ¯onÂ», mi disse, Â«dâi mortali
dove chiave di senso non diserra,

certo non ti dovrien punger li strali
dâammirazione omai, poi dietro ai sensi
vedi che la ragione ha corte lâali.

Ma dimmi quel che tu da te ne pensiÂ».
E io: Â«CiÃ² che nâappar qua sÃ¹ diverso
credo che fanno i corpi rari e densiÂ».

Ed ella: Â«Certo assai vedrai sommerso
nel falso il creder tuo, se bene ascolti
lâargomentar châio li farÃ² avverso.

La spera ottava vi dimostra molti
lumi, li quali e nel quale e nel quanto
notar si posson di diversi volti.

Se raro e denso ciÃ² facesser tanto,
una sola virtÃ¹ sarebbe in tutti,
piÃ¹ e men distributa e altrettanto.

VirtÃ¹ diverse esser convegnon frutti
di princÃ¬pi formali, e quei, for châuno,
seguiterieno a tua ragion distrutti.

Ancor, se raro fosse di quel bruno
cagion che tu dimandi, o dâoltre in parte
fora di sua materia sÃ¬ digiuno

esto pianeto, o, sÃ¬ come comparte
lo grasso e âl magro un corpo, cosÃ¬ questo
nel suo volume cangerebbe carte.

Se âl primo fosse, fora manifesto
ne lâeclissi del sol, per trasparere
lo lume come in altro raro ingesto.

Questo non Ã¨: perÃ² Ã¨ da vedere
de lâaltro; e sâelli avvien châio lâaltro cassi,
falsificato fia lo tuo parere.

Sâelli Ã¨ che questo raro non trapassi,
esser conviene un termine da onde
lo suo contrario piÃ¹ passar non lassi;

e indi lâaltrui raggio si rifonde
cosÃ¬ come color torna per vetro
lo qual di retro a sÃ© piombo nasconde.

Or dirai tu châel si dimostra tetro
ivi lo raggio piÃ¹ che in altre parti,
per esser lÃ¬ refratto piÃ¹ a retro.

Da questa instanza puÃ² deliberarti
esperÃ¯enza, se giÃ  mai la provi,
châesser suol fonte ai rivi di vostrâ arti.

Tre specchi prenderai; e i due rimovi
da te dâun modo, e lâaltro, piÃ¹ rimosso,
trâambo li primi li occhi tuoi ritrovi.

Rivolto ad essi, fa che dopo il dosso
ti stea un lume che i tre specchi accenda
e torni a te da tutti ripercosso.

Ben che nel quanto tanto non si stenda
la vista piÃ¹ lontana, lÃ¬ vedrai
come convien châigualmente risplenda.

Or, come ai colpi de li caldi rai
de la neve riman nudo il suggetto
e dal colore e dal freddo primai,

cosÃ¬ rimaso te ne lâintelletto
voglio informar di luce sÃ¬ vivace,
che ti tremolerÃ  nel suo aspetto.

Dentro dal ciel de la divina pace
si gira un corpo ne la cui virtute
lâesser di tutto suo contento giace.

Lo ciel seguente, câha tante vedute,
quellâ esser parte per diverse essenze,
da lui distratte e da lui contenute.

Li altri giron per varie differenze
le distinzion che dentro da sÃ© hanno
dispongono a lor fini e lor semenze.

Questi organi del mondo cosÃ¬ vanno,
come tu vedi omai, di grado in grado,
che di sÃ¹ prendono e di sotto fanno.

Riguarda bene omai sÃ¬ comâ io vado
per questo loco al vero che disiri,
sÃ¬ che poi sappi sol tener lo guado.

Lo moto e la virtÃ¹ dâi santi giri,
come dal fabbro lâarte del martello,
daâ beati motor convien che spiri;

e âl ciel cui tanti lumi fanno bello,
de la mente profonda che lui volve
prende lâimage e fassene suggello.

E come lâalma dentro a vostra polve
per differenti membra e conformate
a diverse potenze si risolve,

cosÃ¬ lâintelligenza sua bontate
multiplicata per le stelle spiega,
girando sÃ© sovra sua unitate.

VirtÃ¹ diversa fa diversa lega
col prezÃ¯oso corpo châella avviva,
nel qual, sÃ¬ come vita in voi, si lega.

Per la natura lieta onde deriva,
la virtÃ¹ mista per lo corpo luce
come letizia per pupilla viva.

Da essa vien ciÃ² che da luce a luce
par differente, non da denso e raro;
essa Ã¨ formal principio che produce,

conforme a sua bontÃ , lo turbo e âl chiaroÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto III


Quel sol che pria dâamor mi scaldÃ² âl petto,
di bella veritÃ  mâavea scoverto,
provando e riprovando, il dolce aspetto;

e io, per confessar corretto e certo
me stesso, tanto quanto si convenne
levaâ il capo a proferer piÃ¹ erto;

ma visÃ¯one apparve che ritenne
a sÃ© me tanto stretto, per vedersi,
che di mia confession non mi sovvenne.

Quali per vetri trasparenti e tersi,
o ver per acque nitide e tranquille,
non sÃ¬ profonde che i fondi sien persi,

tornan dâi nostri visi le postille
debili sÃ¬, che perla in bianca fronte
non vien men forte a le nostre pupille;

tali vidâ io piÃ¹ facce a parlar pronte;
per châio dentro a lâerror contrario corsi
a quel châaccese amor tra lâomo e âl fonte.

SÃ¹bito sÃ¬ comâ io di lor mâaccorsi,
quelle stimando specchiati sembianti,
per veder di cui fosser, li occhi torsi;

e nulla vidi, e ritorsili avanti
dritti nel lume de la dolce guida,
che, sorridendo, ardea ne li occhi santi.

Â«Non ti maravigliar perchâ io sorridaÂ»,
mi disse, Â«appresso il tuo pÃ¼eril coto,
poi sopra âl vero ancor lo piÃ¨ non fida,

ma te rivolve, come suole, a vÃ²to:
vere sustanze son ciÃ² che tu vedi,
qui rilegate per manco di voto.

PerÃ² parla con esse e odi e credi;
chÃ© la verace luce che le appaga
da sÃ© non lascia lor torcer li piediÂ».

E io a lâombra che parea piÃ¹ vaga
di ragionar, drizzaâmi, e cominciai,
quasi comâ uom cui troppa voglia smaga:

Â«O ben creato spirito, che aâ rai
di vita etterna la dolcezza senti
che, non gustata, non sâintende mai,

grazÃ¯oso mi fia se mi contenti
del nome tuo e de la vostra sorteÂ».
Ondâ ella, pronta e con occhi ridenti:

Â«La nostra caritÃ  non serra porte
a giusta voglia, se non come quella
che vuol simile a sÃ© tutta sua corte.

Iâ fui nel mondo vergine sorella;
e se la mente tua ben sÃ© riguarda,
non mi ti celerÃ  lâesser piÃ¹ bella,

ma riconoscerai châiâ son Piccarda,
che, posta qui con questi altri beati,
beata sono in la spera piÃ¹ tarda.

Li nostri affetti, che solo infiammati
son nel piacer de lo Spirito Santo,
letizian del suo ordine formati.

E questa sorte che par giÃ¹ cotanto,
perÃ² nâÃ¨ data, perchÃ© fuor negletti
li nostri voti, e vÃ²ti in alcun cantoÂ».

Ondâ io a lei: Â«Neâ mirabili aspetti
vostri risplende non so che divino
che vi trasmuta daâ primi concetti:

perÃ² non fui a rimembrar festino;
ma or mâaiuta ciÃ² che tu mi dici,
sÃ¬ che raffigurar mâÃ¨ piÃ¹ latino.

Ma dimmi: voi che siete qui felici,
disiderate voi piÃ¹ alto loco
per piÃ¹ vedere e per piÃ¹ farvi amici?Â».

Con quelle altrâ ombre pria sorrise un poco;
da indi mi rispuose tanto lieta,
châarder parea dâamor nel primo foco:

Â«Frate, la nostra volontÃ  quÃ¯eta
virtÃ¹ di caritÃ , che fa volerne
sol quel châavemo, e dâaltro non ci asseta.

Se disÃ¯assimo esser piÃ¹ superne,
foran discordi li nostri disiri
dal voler di colui che qui ne cerne;

che vedrai non capere in questi giri,
sâessere in caritÃ  Ã¨ qui necesse,
e se la sua natura ben rimiri.

Anzi Ã¨ formale ad esto beato esse
tenersi dentro a la divina voglia,
per châuna fansi nostre voglie stesse;

sÃ¬ che, come noi sem di soglia in soglia
per questo regno, a tutto il regno piace
comâ a lo re che ân suo voler ne ânvoglia.

E ân la sua volontade Ã¨ nostra pace:
ellâ Ã¨ quel mare al qual tutto si move
ciÃ² châella crÃ¯a o che natura faceÂ».

Chiaro mi fu allor come ogne dove
in cielo Ã¨ paradiso, etsi la grazia
del sommo ben dâun modo non vi piove.

Ma sÃ¬ comâ elli avvien, sâun cibo sazia
e dâun altro rimane ancor la gola,
che quel si chere e di quel si ringrazia,

cosÃ¬ fecâ io con atto e con parola,
per apprender da lei qual fu la tela
onde non trasse infino a co la spuola.

Â«Perfetta vita e alto merto inciela
donna piÃ¹ sÃ¹Â», mi disse, Â«a la cui norma
nel vostro mondo giÃ¹ si veste e vela,

perchÃ© fino al morir si vegghi e dorma
con quello sposo châogne voto accetta
che caritate a suo piacer conforma.

Dal mondo, per seguirla, giovinetta
fuggiâmi, e nel suo abito mi chiusi
e promisi la via de la sua setta.

Uomini poi, a mal piÃ¹ châa bene usi,
fuor mi rapiron de la dolce chiostra:
Iddio si sa qual poi mia vita fusi.

E questâ altro splendor che ti si mostra
da la mia destra parte e che sâaccende
di tutto il lume de la spera nostra,

ciÃ² châio dico di me, di sÃ© intende;
sorella fu, e cosÃ¬ le fu tolta
di capo lâombra de le sacre bende.

Ma poi che pur al mondo fu rivolta
contra suo grado e contra buona usanza,
non fu dal vel del cor giÃ  mai disciolta.

Questâ Ã¨ la luce de la gran Costanza
che del secondo vento di Soave
generÃ² âl terzo e lâultima possanzaÂ».

CosÃ¬ parlommi, e poi cominciÃ² âAve,
Mariaâ cantando, e cantando vanio
come per acqua cupa cosa grave.

La vista mia, che tanto lei seguio
quanto possibil fu, poi che la perse,
volsesi al segno di maggior disio,

e a Beatrice tutta si converse;
ma quella folgorÃ² nel mÃ¯o sguardo
sÃ¬ che da prima il viso non sofferse;

e ciÃ² mi fece a dimandar piÃ¹ tardo.



Paradiso Â· Canto IV


Intra due cibi, distanti e moventi
dâun modo, prima si morria di fame,
che liberâ omo lâun recasse ai denti;

sÃ¬ si starebbe un agno intra due brame
di fieri lupi, igualmente temendo;
sÃ¬ si starebbe un cane intra due dame:

per che, sâiâ mi tacea, me non riprendo,
da li miei dubbi dâun modo sospinto,
poi châera necessario, nÃ© commendo.

Io mi tacea, ma âl mio disir dipinto
mâera nel viso, e âl dimandar con ello,
piÃ¹ caldo assai che per parlar distinto.

FÃ© sÃ¬ Beatrice qual fÃ© DanÃ¯ello,
Nabuccodonosor levando dâira,
che lâavea fatto ingiustamente fello;

e disse: Â«Io veggio ben come ti tira
uno e altro disio, sÃ¬ che tua cura
sÃ© stessa lega sÃ¬ che fuor non spira.

Tu argomenti: âSe âl buon voler dura,
la vÃ¯olenza altrui per qual ragione
di meritar mi scema la misura?â.

Ancor di dubitar ti dÃ  cagione
parer tornarsi lâanime a le stelle,
secondo la sentenza di Platone.

Queste son le question che nel tuo velle
pontano igualmente; e perÃ² pria
tratterÃ² quella che piÃ¹ ha di felle.

Dâi Serafin colui che piÃ¹ sâindia,
MoÃ¯sÃ¨, Samuel, e quel Giovanni
che prender vuoli, io dico, non Maria,

non hanno in altro cielo i loro scanni
che questi spirti che mo tâappariro,
nÃ© hanno a lâesser lor piÃ¹ o meno anni;

ma tutti fanno bello il primo giro,
e differentemente han dolce vita
per sentir piÃ¹ e men lâetterno spiro.

Qui si mostraro, non perchÃ© sortita
sia questa spera lor, ma per far segno
de la celestÃ¯al câha men salita.

CosÃ¬ parlar conviensi al vostro ingegno,
perÃ² che solo da sensato apprende
ciÃ² che fa poscia dâintelletto degno.

Per questo la Scrittura condescende
a vostra facultate, e piedi e mano
attribuisce a Dio e altro intende;

e Santa Chiesa con aspetto umano
GabrÃ¯el e Michel vi rappresenta,
e lâaltro che Tobia rifece sano.

Quel che Timeo de lâanime argomenta
non Ã¨ simile a ciÃ² che qui si vede,
perÃ² che, come dice, par che senta.

Dice che lâalma a la sua stella riede,
credendo quella quindi esser decisa
quando natura per forma la diede;

e forse sua sentenza Ã¨ dâaltra guisa
che la voce non suona, ed esser puote
con intenzion da non esser derisa.

Sâelli intende tornare a queste ruote
lâonor de la influenza e âl biasmo, forse
in alcun vero suo arco percuote.

Questo principio, male inteso, torse
giÃ  tutto il mondo quasi, sÃ¬ che Giove,
Mercurio e Marte a nominar trascorse.

Lâaltra dubitazion che ti commove
ha men velen, perÃ² che sua malizia
non ti poria menar da me altrove.

Parere ingiusta la nostra giustizia
ne li occhi dâi mortali, Ã¨ argomento
di fede e non dâeretica nequizia.

Ma perchÃ© puote vostro accorgimento
ben penetrare a questa veritate,
come disiri, ti farÃ² contento.

Se vÃ¯olenza Ã¨ quando quel che pate
nÃ¯ente conferisce a quel che sforza,
non fuor questâ alme per essa scusate:

chÃ© volontÃ , se non vuol, non sâammorza,
ma fa come natura face in foco,
se mille volte vÃ¯olenza il torza.

Per che, sâella si piega assai o poco,
segue la forza; e cosÃ¬ queste fero
possendo rifuggir nel santo loco.

Se fosse stato lor volere intero,
come tenne Lorenzo in su la grada,
e fece Muzio a la sua man severo,

cosÃ¬ lâavria ripinte per la strada
ondâ eran tratte, come fuoro sciolte;
ma cosÃ¬ salda voglia Ã¨ troppo rada.

E per queste parole, se ricolte
lâhai come dei, Ã¨ lâargomento casso
che tâavria fatto noia ancor piÃ¹ volte.

Ma or ti sâattraversa un altro passo
dinanzi a li occhi, tal che per te stesso
non usciresti: pria saresti lasso.

Io tâho per certo ne la mente messo
châalma beata non poria mentire,
perÃ² châÃ¨ sempre al primo vero appresso;

e poi potesti da Piccarda udire
che lâaffezion del vel Costanza tenne;
sÃ¬ châella par qui meco contradire.

Molte fÃ¯ate giÃ , frate, addivenne
che, per fuggir periglio, contra grato
si fÃ© di quel che far non si convenne;

come Almeone, che, di ciÃ² pregato
dal padre suo, la propria madre spense,
per non perder pietÃ  si fÃ© spietato.

A questo punto voglio che tu pense
che la forza al voler si mischia, e fanno
sÃ¬ che scusar non si posson lâoffense.

Voglia assoluta non consente al danno;
ma consentevi in tanto in quanto teme,
se si ritrae, cadere in piÃ¹ affanno.

PerÃ², quando Piccarda quello spreme,
de la voglia assoluta intende, e io
de lâaltra; sÃ¬ che ver diciamo insiemeÂ».

Cotal fu lâondeggiar del santo rio
châuscÃ¬ del fonte ondâ ogne ver deriva;
tal puose in pace uno e altro disio.

Â«O amanza del primo amante, o divaÂ»,
dissâ io appresso, Â«il cui parlar mâinonda
e scalda sÃ¬, che piÃ¹ e piÃ¹ mâavviva,

non Ã¨ lâaffezion mia tanto profonda,
che basti a render voi grazia per grazia;
ma quei che vede e puote a ciÃ² risponda.

Io veggio ben che giÃ  mai non si sazia
nostro intelletto, se âl ver non lo illustra
di fuor dal qual nessun vero si spazia.

Posasi in esso, come fera in lustra,
tosto che giunto lâha; e giugner puollo:
se non, ciascun disio sarebbe frustra.

Nasce per quello, a guisa di rampollo,
a piÃ¨ del vero il dubbio; ed Ã¨ natura
châal sommo pinge noi di collo in collo.

Questo mâinvita, questo mâassicura
con reverenza, donna, a dimandarvi
dâunâaltra veritÃ  che mâÃ¨ oscura.

Io voâ saper se lâuom puÃ² sodisfarvi
ai voti manchi sÃ¬ con altri beni,
châa la vostra statera non sien parviÂ».

Beatrice mi guardÃ² con li occhi pieni
di faville dâamor cosÃ¬ divini,
che, vinta, mia virtute diÃ¨ le reni,

e quasi mi perdei con li occhi chini.



Paradiso Â· Canto V


Â«Sâio ti fiammeggio nel caldo dâamore
di lÃ  dal modo che ân terra si vede,
sÃ¬ che del viso tuo vinco il valore,

non ti maravigliar, chÃ© ciÃ² procede
da perfetto veder, che, come apprende,
cosÃ¬ nel bene appreso move il piede.

Io veggio ben sÃ¬ come giÃ  resplende
ne lâintelletto tuo lâetterna luce,
che, vista, sola e sempre amore accende;

e sâaltra cosa vostro amor seduce,
non Ã¨ se non di quella alcun vestigio,
mal conosciuto, che quivi traluce.

Tu vuoâ saper se con altro servigio,
per manco voto, si puÃ² render tanto
che lâanima sicuri di letigioÂ».

SÃ¬ cominciÃ² Beatrice questo canto;
e sÃ¬ comâ uom che suo parlar non spezza,
continÃ¼Ã² cosÃ¬ âl processo santo:

Â«Lo maggior don che Dio per sua larghezza
fesse creando, e a la sua bontate
piÃ¹ conformato, e quel châeâ piÃ¹ apprezza,

fu de la volontÃ  la libertate;
di che le creature intelligenti,
e tutte e sole, fuoro e son dotate.

Or ti parrÃ , se tu quinci argomenti,
lâalto valor del voto, sâÃ¨ sÃ¬ fatto
che Dio consenta quando tu consenti;

chÃ©, nel fermar tra Dio e lâomo il patto,
vittima fassi di questo tesoro,
tal quale io dico; e fassi col suo atto.

Dunque che render puossi per ristoro?
Se credi bene usar quel câhai offerto,
di maltolletto vuoâ far buon lavoro.

Tu seâ omai del maggior punto certo;
ma perchÃ© Santa Chiesa in ciÃ² dispensa,
che par contra lo ver châiâ tâho scoverto,

convienti ancor sedere un poco a mensa,
perÃ² che âl cibo rigido câhai preso,
richiede ancora aiuto a tua dispensa.

Apri la mente a quel châio ti paleso
e fermalvi entro; chÃ© non fa scÃ¯enza,
sanza lo ritenere, avere inteso.

Due cose si convegnono a lâessenza
di questo sacrificio: lâuna Ã¨ quella
di che si fa; lâaltrâ Ã¨ la convenenza.

Questâ ultima giÃ  mai non si cancella
se non servata; e intorno di lei
sÃ¬ preciso di sopra si favella:

perÃ² necessitato fu a li Ebrei
pur lâofferere, ancor châalcuna offerta
sÃ¬ permutasse, come saver dei.

Lâaltra, che per materia tâÃ¨ aperta,
puote ben esser tal, che non si falla
se con altra materia si converta.

Ma non trasmuti carco a la sua spalla
per suo arbitrio alcun, sanza la volta
e de la chiave bianca e de la gialla;

e ogne permutanza credi stolta,
se la cosa dimessa in la sorpresa
come âl quattro nel sei non Ã¨ raccolta.

PerÃ² qualunque cosa tanto pesa
per suo valor che tragga ogne bilancia,
sodisfar non si puÃ² con altra spesa.

Non prendan li mortali il voto a ciancia;
siate fedeli, e a ciÃ² far non bieci,
come IeptÃ¨ a la sua prima mancia;

cui piÃ¹ si convenia dicer âMal feciâ,
che, servando, far peggio; e cosÃ¬ stolto
ritrovar puoi il gran duca deâ Greci,

onde pianse EfigÃ¨nia il suo bel volto,
e fÃ© pianger di sÃ© i folli e i savi
châudir parlar di cosÃ¬ fatto cÃ³lto.

Siate, Cristiani, a muovervi piÃ¹ gravi:
non siate come penna ad ogne vento,
e non crediate châogne acqua vi lavi.

Avete il novo e âl vecchio Testamento,
e âl pastor de la Chiesa che vi guida;
questo vi basti a vostro salvamento.

Se mala cupidigia altro vi grida,
uomini siate, e non pecore matte,
sÃ¬ che âl Giudeo di voi tra voi non rida!

Non fate comâ agnel che lascia il latte
de la sua madre, e semplice e lascivo
seco medesmo a suo piacer combatte!Â».

CosÃ¬ Beatrice a me comâ Ã¯o scrivo;
poi si rivolse tutta disÃ¯ante
a quella parte ove âl mondo Ã¨ piÃ¹ vivo.

Lo suo tacere e âl trasmutar sembiante
puoser silenzio al mio cupido ingegno,
che giÃ  nuove questioni avea davante;

e sÃ¬ come saetta che nel segno
percuote pria che sia la corda queta,
cosÃ¬ corremmo nel secondo regno.

Quivi la donna mia vidâ io sÃ¬ lieta,
come nel lume di quel ciel si mise,
che piÃ¹ lucente se ne fÃ© âl pianeta.

E se la stella si cambiÃ² e rise,
qual mi fecâ io che pur da mia natura
trasmutabile son per tutte guise!

Come ân peschiera châÃ¨ tranquilla e pura
traggonsi i pesci a ciÃ² che vien di fori
per modo che lo stimin lor pastura,

sÃ¬ vidâ io ben piÃ¹ di mille splendori
trarsi verâ noi, e in ciascun sâudia:
Â«Ecco chi crescerÃ  li nostri amoriÂ».

E sÃ¬ come ciascuno a noi venÃ¬a,
vedeasi lâombra piena di letizia
nel folgÃ³r chiaro che di lei uscia.

Pensa, lettor, se quel che qui sâinizia
non procedesse, come tu avresti
di piÃ¹ savere angosciosa carizia;

e per te vederai come da questi
mâera in disio dâudir lor condizioni,
sÃ¬ come a li occhi mi fur manifesti.

Â«O bene nato a cui veder li troni
del trÃ¯unfo etternal concede grazia
prima che la milizia sâabbandoni,

del lume che per tutto il ciel si spazia
noi semo accesi; e perÃ², se disii
di noi chiarirti, a tuo piacer ti saziaÂ».

CosÃ¬ da un di quelli spirti pii
detto mi fu; e da Beatrice: Â«DÃ¬, dÃ¬
sicuramente, e credi come a diiÂ».

Â«Io veggio ben sÃ¬ come tu tâannidi
nel proprio lume, e che de li occhi il traggi,
perchâ eâ corusca sÃ¬ come tu ridi;

ma non so chi tu seâ, nÃ© perchÃ© aggi,
anima degna, il grado de la spera
che si vela aâ mortai con altrui raggiÂ».

Questo dissâ io diritto a la lumera
che pria mâavea parlato; ondâ ella fessi
lucente piÃ¹ assai di quel châellâ era.

SÃ¬ come il sol che si cela elli stessi
per troppa luce, come âl caldo ha rÃ³se
le temperanze dâi vapori spessi,

per piÃ¹ letizia sÃ¬ mi si nascose
dentro al suo raggio la figura santa;
e cosÃ¬ chiusa chiusa mi rispuose

nel modo che âl seguente canto canta.



Paradiso Â· Canto VI


Â«Poscia che Costantin lâaquila volse
contrâ al corso del ciel, châella seguio
dietro a lâantico che Lavina tolse,

cento e centâ anni e piÃ¹ lâuccel di Dio
ne lo stremo dâEuropa si ritenne,
vicino aâ monti deâ quai prima uscÃ¬o;

e sotto lâombra de le sacre penne
governÃ² âl mondo lÃ¬ di mano in mano,
e, sÃ¬ cangiando, in su la mia pervenne.

Cesare fui e son IustinÃ¯ano,
che, per voler del primo amor châiâ sento,
dâentro le leggi trassi il troppo e âl vano.

E prima châio a lâovra fossi attento,
una natura in Cristo esser, non piÃ¹e,
credea, e di tal fede era contento;

ma âl benedetto Agapito, che fue
sommo pastore, a la fede sincera
mi dirizzÃ² con le parole sue.

Io li credetti; e ciÃ² che ân sua fede era,
veggâ io or chiaro sÃ¬, come tu vedi
ogni contradizione e falsa e vera.

Tosto che con la Chiesa mossi i piedi,
a Dio per grazia piacque di spirarmi
lâalto lavoro, e tutto ân lui mi diedi;

e al mio Belisar commendai lâarmi,
cui la destra del ciel fu sÃ¬ congiunta,
che segno fu châiâ dovessi posarmi.

Or qui a la question prima sâappunta
la mia risposta; ma sua condizione
mi stringe a seguitare alcuna giunta,

perchÃ© tu veggi con quanta ragione
si move contrâ al sacrosanto segno
e chi âl sâappropria e chi a lui sâoppone.

Vedi quanta virtÃ¹ lâha fatto degno
di reverenza; e cominciÃ² da lâora
che Pallante morÃ¬ per darli regno.

Tu sai châel fece in Alba sua dimora
per trecento anni e oltre, infino al fine
che i tre aâ tre pugnar per lui ancora.

E sai châel fÃ© dal mal de le Sabine
al dolor di Lucrezia in sette regi,
vincendo intorno le genti vicine.

Sai quel châel fÃ© portato da li egregi
Romani incontro a Brenno, incontro a Pirro,
incontro a li altri principi e collegi;

onde Torquato e Quinzio, che dal cirro
negletto fu nomato, i Deci e â Fabi
ebber la fama che volontier mirro.

Esso atterrÃ² lâorgoglio de li ArÃ bi
che di retro ad Anibale passaro
lâalpestre rocce, Po, di che tu labi.

Sottâ esso giovanetti trÃ¯unfaro
ScipÃ¯one e Pompeo; e a quel colle
sotto âl qual tu nascesti parve amaro.

Poi, presso al tempo che tutto âl ciel volle
redur lo mondo a suo modo sereno,
Cesare per voler di Roma il tolle.

E quel che fÃ© da Varo infino a Reno,
Isara vide ed Era e vide Senna
e ogne valle onde Rodano Ã¨ pieno.

Quel che fÃ© poi châelli uscÃ¬ di Ravenna
e saltÃ² Rubicon, fu di tal volo,
che nol seguiteria lingua nÃ© penna.

Inverâ la Spagna rivolse lo stuolo,
poi verâ Durazzo, e Farsalia percosse
sÃ¬ châal Nil caldo si sentÃ¬ del duolo.

Antandro e Simeonta, onde si mosse,
rivide e lÃ  dovâ Ettore si cuba;
e mal per Tolomeo poscia si scosse.

Da indi scese folgorando a Iuba;
onde si volse nel vostro occidente,
ove sentia la pompeana tuba.

Di quel che fÃ© col baiulo seguente,
Bruto con Cassio ne lâinferno latra,
e Modena e Perugia fu dolente.

Piangene ancor la trista Cleopatra,
che, fuggendoli innanzi, dal colubro
la morte prese subitana e atra.

Con costui corse infino al lito rubro;
con costui puose il mondo in tanta pace,
che fu serrato a Giano il suo delubro.

Ma ciÃ² che âl segno che parlar mi face
fatto avea prima e poi era fatturo
per lo regno mortal châa lui soggiace,

diventa in apparenza poco e scuro,
se in mano al terzo Cesare si mira
con occhio chiaro e con affetto puro;

chÃ© la viva giustizia che mi spira,
li concedette, in mano a quel châiâ dico,
gloria di far vendetta a la sua ira.

Or qui tâammira in ciÃ² châio ti replÃ¬co:
poscia con Tito a far vendetta corse
de la vendetta del peccato antico.

E quando il dente longobardo morse
la Santa Chiesa, sotto le sue ali
Carlo Magno, vincendo, la soccorse.

Omai puoi giudicar di quei cotali
châio accusai di sopra e di lor falli,
che son cagion di tutti vostri mali.

Lâuno al pubblico segno i gigli gialli
oppone, e lâaltro appropria quello a parte,
sÃ¬ châÃ¨ forte a veder chi piÃ¹ si falli.

Faccian li Ghibellin, faccian lor arte
sottâ altro segno, chÃ© mal segue quello
sempre chi la giustizia e lui diparte;

e non lâabbatta esto Carlo novello
coi Guelfi suoi, ma tema de li artigli
châa piÃ¹ alto leon trasser lo vello.

Molte fÃ¯ate giÃ  pianser li figli
per la colpa del padre, e non si creda
che Dio trasmuti lâarmi per suoi gigli!

Questa picciola stella si correda
dâi buoni spirti che son stati attivi
perchÃ© onore e fama li succeda:

e quando li disiri poggian quivi,
sÃ¬ disvÃ¯ando, pur convien che i raggi
del vero amore in sÃ¹ poggin men vivi.

Ma nel commensurar dâi nostri gaggi
col merto Ã¨ parte di nostra letizia,
perchÃ© non li vedem minor nÃ© maggi.

Quindi addolcisce la viva giustizia
in noi lâaffetto sÃ¬, che non si puote
torcer giÃ  mai ad alcuna nequizia.

Diverse voci fanno dolci note;
cosÃ¬ diversi scanni in nostra vita
rendon dolce armonia tra queste rote.

E dentro a la presente margarita
luce la luce di Romeo, di cui
fu lâovra grande e bella mal gradita.

Ma i Provenzai che fecer contra lui
non hanno riso; e perÃ² mal cammina
qual si fa danno del ben fare altrui.

Quattro figlie ebbe, e ciascuna reina,
Ramondo Beringhiere, e ciÃ² li fece
Romeo, persona umÃ¬le e peregrina.

E poi il mosser le parole biece
a dimandar ragione a questo giusto,
che li assegnÃ² sette e cinque per diece,

indi partissi povero e vetusto;
e se âl mondo sapesse il cor châelli ebbe
mendicando sua vita a frusto a frusto,

assai lo loda, e piÃ¹ lo loderebbeÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto VII


Â«Osanna, sanctus Deus sabaÃ²th,
superillustrans claritate tua
felices ignes horum malacÃ²th!Â».

CosÃ¬, volgendosi a la nota sua,
fu viso a me cantare essa sustanza,
sopra la qual doppio lume sâaddua;

ed essa e lâaltre mossero a sua danza,
e quasi velocissime faville
mi si velar di sÃ¹bita distanza.

Io dubitava e dicea âDille, dille!â
fra me, âdilleâ dicea, âa la mia donna
che mi diseta con le dolci stilleâ.

Ma quella reverenza che sâindonna
di tutto me, pur per Be e per ice,
mi richinava come lâuom châassonna.

Poco sofferse me cotal Beatrice
e cominciÃ², raggiandomi dâun riso
tal, che nel foco faria lâuom felice:

Â«Secondo mio infallibile avviso,
come giusta vendetta giustamente
punita fosse, tâha in pensier miso;

ma io ti solverÃ² tosto la mente;
e tu ascolta, chÃ© le mie parole
di gran sentenza ti faran presente.

Per non soffrire a la virtÃ¹ che vole
freno a suo prode, quellâ uom che non nacque,
dannando sÃ©, dannÃ² tutta sua prole;

onde lâumana specie inferma giacque
giÃ¹ per secoli molti in grande errore,
fin châal Verbo di Dio discender piacque

uâ la natura, che dal suo fattore
sâera allungata, unÃ¬ a sÃ© in persona
con lâatto sol del suo etterno amore.

Or drizza il viso a quel châor si ragiona:
questa natura al suo fattore unita,
qual fu creata, fu sincera e buona;

ma per sÃ© stessa pur fu ella sbandita
di paradiso, perÃ² che si torse
da via di veritÃ  e da sua vita.

La pena dunque che la croce porse
sâa la natura assunta si misura,
nulla giÃ  mai sÃ¬ giustamente morse;

e cosÃ¬ nulla fu di tanta ingiura,
guardando a la persona che sofferse,
in che era contratta tal natura.

PerÃ² dâun atto uscir cose diverse:
châa Dio e aâ Giudei piacque una morte;
per lei tremÃ² la terra e âl ciel sâaperse.

Non ti dee oramai parer piÃ¹ forte,
quando si dice che giusta vendetta
poscia vengiata fu da giusta corte.

Ma io veggiâ or la tua mente ristretta
di pensiero in pensier dentro ad un nodo,
del qual con gran disio solver sâaspetta.

Tu dici: âBen discerno ciÃ² châiâ odo;
ma perchÃ© Dio volesse, mâÃ¨ occulto,
a nostra redenzion pur questo modoâ.

Questo decreto, frate, sta sepulto
a li occhi di ciascuno il cui ingegno
ne la fiamma dâamor non Ã¨ adulto.

Veramente, perÃ² châa questo segno
molto si mira e poco si discerne,
dirÃ² perchÃ© tal modo fu piÃ¹ degno.

La divina bontÃ , che da sÃ© sperne
ogne livore, ardendo in sÃ©, sfavilla
sÃ¬ che dispiega le bellezze etterne.

CiÃ² che da lei sanza mezzo distilla
non ha poi fine, perchÃ© non si move
la sua imprenta quandâ ella sigilla.

CiÃ² che da essa sanza mezzo piove
libero Ã¨ tutto, perchÃ© non soggiace
a la virtute de le cose nove.

PiÃ¹ lâÃ¨ conforme, e perÃ² piÃ¹ le piace;
chÃ© lâardor santo châogne cosa raggia,
ne la piÃ¹ somigliante Ã¨ piÃ¹ vivace.

Di tutte queste dote sâavvantaggia
lâumana creatura, e sâuna manca,
di sua nobilitÃ  convien che caggia.

Solo il peccato Ã¨ quel che la disfranca
e falla dissimÃ¬le al sommo bene,
per che del lume suo poco sâimbianca;

e in sua dignitÃ  mai non rivene,
se non rÃ¯empie, dove colpa vÃ²ta,
contra mal dilettar con giuste pene.

Vostra natura, quando peccÃ² tota
nel seme suo, da queste dignitadi,
come di paradiso, fu remota;

nÃ© ricovrar potiensi, se tu badi
ben sottilmente, per alcuna via,
sanza passar per un di questi guadi:

o che Dio solo per sua cortesia
dimesso avesse, o che lâuom per sÃ© isso
avesse sodisfatto a sua follia.

Ficca mo lâocchio per entro lâabisso
de lâetterno consiglio, quanto puoi
al mio parlar distrettamente fisso.

Non potea lâuomo neâ termini suoi
mai sodisfar, per non potere ir giuso
con umiltate obedÃ¯endo poi,

quanto disobediendo intese ir suso;
e questa Ã¨ la cagion per che lâuom fue
da poter sodisfar per sÃ© dischiuso.

Dunque a Dio convenia con le vie sue
riparar lâomo a sua intera vita,
dico con lâuna, o ver con amendue.

Ma perchÃ© lâovra tanto Ã¨ piÃ¹ gradita
da lâoperante, quanto piÃ¹ appresenta
de la bontÃ  del core ondâ ellâ Ã¨ uscita,

la divina bontÃ  che âl mondo imprenta,
di proceder per tutte le sue vie,
a rilevarvi suso, fu contenta.

NÃ© tra lâultima notte e âl primo die
sÃ¬ alto o sÃ¬ magnifico processo,
o per lâuna o per lâaltra, fu o fie:

chÃ© piÃ¹ largo fu Dio a dar sÃ© stesso
per far lâuom sufficiente a rilevarsi,
che sâelli avesse sol da sÃ© dimesso;

e tutti li altri modi erano scarsi
a la giustizia, se âl Figliuol di Dio
non fosse umilÃ¯ato ad incarnarsi.

Or per empierti bene ogne disio,
ritorno a dichiararti in alcun loco,
perchÃ© tu veggi lÃ¬ cosÃ¬ comâ io.

Tu dici: âIo veggio lâacqua, io veggio il foco,
lâaere e la terra e tutte lor misture
venire a corruzione, e durar poco;

e queste cose pur furon creature;
per che, se ciÃ² châÃ¨ detto Ã¨ stato vero,
esser dovrien da corruzion sicureâ.

Li angeli, frate, e âl paese sincero
nel qual tu seâ, dir si posson creati,
sÃ¬ come sono, in loro essere intero;

ma li alimenti che tu hai nomati
e quelle cose che di lor si fanno
da creata virtÃ¹ sono informati.

Creata fu la materia châelli hanno;
creata fu la virtÃ¹ informante
in queste stelle che ântorno a lor vanno.

Lâanima dâogne bruto e de le piante
di complession potenzÃ¯ata tira
lo raggio e âl moto de le luci sante;

ma vostra vita sanza mezzo spira
la somma beninanza, e la innamora
di sÃ© sÃ¬ che poi sempre la disira.

E quinci puoi argomentare ancora
vostra resurrezion, se tu ripensi
come lâumana carne fessi allora

che li primi parenti intrambo fensiÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto VIII


Solea creder lo mondo in suo periclo
che la bella Ciprigna il folle amore
raggiasse, volta nel terzo epiciclo;

per che non pur a lei faceano onore
di sacrificio e di votivo grido
le genti antiche ne lâantico errore;

ma DÃ¯one onoravano e Cupido,
quella per madre sua, questo per figlio,
e dicean châel sedette in grembo a Dido;

e da costei ondâ io principio piglio
pigliavano il vocabol de la stella
che âl sol vagheggia or da coppa or da ciglio.

Io non mâaccorsi del salire in ella;
ma dâesservi entro mi fÃ© assai fede
la donna mia châiâ vidi far piÃ¹ bella.

E come in fiamma favilla si vede,
e come in voce voce si discerne,
quandâ una Ã¨ ferma e altra va e riede,

vidâ io in essa luce altre lucerne
muoversi in giro piÃ¹ e men correnti,
al modo, credo, di lor viste interne.

Di fredda nube non disceser venti,
o visibili o no, tanto festini,
che non paressero impediti e lenti

a chi avesse quei lumi divini
veduti a noi venir, lasciando il giro
pria cominciato in li alti Serafini;

e dentro a quei che piÃ¹ innanzi appariro
sonava âOsannaâ sÃ¬, che unque poi
di rÃ¯udir non fui sanza disiro.

Indi si fece lâun piÃ¹ presso a noi
e solo incominciÃ²: Â«Tutti sem presti
al tuo piacer, perchÃ© di noi ti gioi.

Noi ci volgiam coi principi celesti
dâun giro e dâun girare e dâuna sete,
ai quali tu del mondo giÃ  dicesti:

âVoi che ântendendo il terzo ciel moveteâ;
e sem sÃ¬ pien dâamor, che, per piacerti,
non fia men dolce un poco di quÃ¯eteÂ».

Poscia che li occhi miei si fuoro offerti
a la mia donna reverenti, ed essa
fatti li avea di sÃ© contenti e certi,

rivolsersi a la luce che promessa
tanto sâavea, e Â«Deh, chi siete?Â» fue
la voce mia di grande affetto impressa.

E quanta e quale vidâ io lei far piÃ¹e
per allegrezza nova che sâaccrebbe,
quando parlai, a lâallegrezze sue!

CosÃ¬ fatta, mi disse: Â«Il mondo mâebbe
giÃ¹ poco tempo; e se piÃ¹ fosse stato,
molto sarÃ  di mal, che non sarebbe.

La mia letizia mi ti tien celato
che mi raggia dintorno e mi nasconde
quasi animal di sua seta fasciato.

Assai mâamasti, e avesti ben onde;
che sâio fossi giÃ¹ stato, io ti mostrava
di mio amor piÃ¹ oltre che le fronde.

Quella sinistra riva che si lava
di Rodano poi châÃ¨ misto con Sorga,
per suo segnore a tempo mâaspettava,

e quel corno dâAusonia che sâimborga
di Bari e di Gaeta e di Catona,
da ove Tronto e Verde in mare sgorga.

Fulgeami giÃ  in fronte la corona
di quella terra che âl Danubio riga
poi che le ripe tedesche abbandona.

E la bella Trinacria, che caliga
tra Pachino e Peloro, sopra âl golfo
che riceve da Euro maggior briga,

non per Tifeo ma per nascente solfo,
attesi avrebbe li suoi regi ancora,
nati per me di Carlo e di Ridolfo,

se mala segnoria, che sempre accora
li popoli suggetti, non avesse
mosso Palermo a gridar: âMora, mora!â.

E se mio frate questo antivedesse,
lâavara povertÃ  di Catalogna
giÃ  fuggeria, perchÃ© non li offendesse;

chÃ© veramente proveder bisogna
per lui, o per altrui, sÃ¬ châa sua barca
carcata piÃ¹ dâincarco non si pogna.

La sua natura, che di larga parca
discese, avria mestier di tal milizia
che non curasse di mettere in arcaÂ».

Â«PerÃ² châiâ credo che lâalta letizia
che âl tuo parlar mâinfonde, segnor mio,
lÃ  âve ogne ben si termina e sâinizia,

per te si veggia come la veggâ io,
grata mâÃ¨ piÃ¹; e anco questâ ho caro
perchÃ© âl discerni rimirando in Dio.

Fatto mâhai lieto, e cosÃ¬ mi fa chiaro,
poi che, parlando, a dubitar mâhai mosso
comâ esser puÃ², di dolce seme, amaroÂ».

Questo io a lui; ed elli a me: Â«Sâio posso
mostrarti un vero, a quel che tu dimandi
terrai lo viso come tien lo dosso.

Lo ben che tutto il regno che tu scandi
volge e contenta, fa esser virtute
sua provedenza in questi corpi grandi.

E non pur le nature provedute
sono in la mente châÃ¨ da sÃ© perfetta,
ma esse insieme con la lor salute:

per che quantunque questâ arco saetta
disposto cade a proveduto fine,
sÃ¬ come cosa in suo segno diretta.

Se ciÃ² non fosse, il ciel che tu cammine
producerebbe sÃ¬ li suoi effetti,
che non sarebbero arti, ma ruine;

e ciÃ² esser non puÃ², se li ântelletti
che muovon queste stelle non son manchi,
e manco il primo, che non li ha perfetti.

Vuoâ tu che questo ver piÃ¹ ti sâimbianchi?Â».
E io: Â«Non giÃ ; chÃ© impossibil veggio
che la natura, in quel châÃ¨ uopo, stanchiÂ».

Ondâ elli ancora: Â«Or dÃ¬: sarebbe il peggio
per lâomo in terra, se non fosse cive?Â».
Â«SÃ¬Â», rispuosâ io; Â«e qui ragion non cheggioÂ».

Â«E puotâ elli esser, se giÃ¹ non si vive
diversamente per diversi offici?
Non, se âl maestro vostro ben vi scriveÂ».

SÃ¬ venne deducendo infino a quici;
poscia conchiuse: Â«Dunque esser diverse
convien di vostri effetti le radici:

per châun nasce Solone e altro Serse,
altro MelchisedÃ¨ch e altro quello
che, volando per lâaere, il figlio perse.

La circular natura, châÃ¨ suggello
a la cera mortal, fa ben sua arte,
ma non distingue lâun da lâaltro ostello.

Quinci addivien châEsaÃ¹ si diparte
per seme da IacÃ²b; e vien Quirino
da sÃ¬ vil padre, che si rende a Marte.

Natura generata il suo cammino
simil farebbe sempre aâ generanti,
se non vincesse il proveder divino.

Or quel che tâera dietro tâÃ¨ davanti:
ma perchÃ© sappi che di te mi giova,
un corollario voglio che tâammanti.

Sempre natura, se fortuna trova
discorde a sÃ©, comâ ogne altra semente
fuor di sua regÃ¯on, fa mala prova.

E se âl mondo lÃ  giÃ¹ ponesse mente
al fondamento che natura pone,
seguendo lui, avria buona la gente.

Ma voi torcete a la religÃ¯one
tal che fia nato a cignersi la spada,
e fate re di tal châÃ¨ da sermone;

onde la traccia vostra Ã¨ fuor di stradaÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto IX


Da poi che Carlo tuo, bella Clemenza,
mâebbe chiarito, mi narrÃ² li ânganni
che ricever dovea la sua semenza;

ma disse: Â«Taci e lascia muover li anniÂ»;
sÃ¬ châio non posso dir se non che pianto
giusto verrÃ  di retro ai vostri danni.

E giÃ  la vita di quel lume santo
rivolta sâera al Sol che la rÃ¯empie
come quel ben châa ogne cosa Ã¨ tanto.

Ahi anime ingannate e fatture empie,
che da sÃ¬ fatto ben torcete i cuori,
drizzando in vanitÃ  le vostre tempie!

Ed ecco un altro di quelli splendori
verâ me si fece, e âl suo voler piacermi
significava nel chiarir di fori.

Li occhi di BÃ«atrice, châeran fermi
sovra me, come pria, di caro assenso
al mio disio certificato fermi.

Â«Deh, metti al mio voler tosto compenso,
beato spirtoÂ», dissi, Â«e fammi prova
châiâ possa in te refletter quel châio penso!Â».

Onde la luce che mâera ancor nova,
del suo profondo, ondâ ella pria cantava,
seguette come a cui di ben far giova:

Â«In quella parte de la terra prava
italica che siede tra RÃ¯alto
e le fontane di Brenta e di Piava,

si leva un colle, e non surge moltâ alto,
lÃ  onde scese giÃ  una facella
che fece a la contrada un grande assalto.

Dâuna radice nacqui e io ed ella:
Cunizza fui chiamata, e qui refulgo
perchÃ© mi vinse il lume dâesta stella;

ma lietamente a me medesma indulgo
la cagion di mia sorte, e non mi noia;
che parria forse forte al vostro vulgo.

Di questa luculenta e cara gioia
del nostro cielo che piÃ¹ mâÃ¨ propinqua,
grande fama rimase; e pria che moia,

questo centesimo anno ancor sâincinqua:
vedi se far si dee lâomo eccellente,
sÃ¬ châaltra vita la prima relinqua.

E ciÃ² non pensa la turba presente
che Tagliamento e Adice richiude,
nÃ© per esser battuta ancor si pente;

ma tosto fia che Padova al palude
cangerÃ  lâacqua che Vincenza bagna,
per essere al dover le genti crude;

e dove Sile e Cagnan sâaccompagna,
tal signoreggia e va con la testa alta,
che giÃ  per lui carpir si fa la ragna.

PiangerÃ  Feltro ancora la difalta
de lâempio suo pastor, che sarÃ  sconcia
sÃ¬, che per simil non sâentrÃ² in malta.

Troppo sarebbe larga la bigoncia
che ricevesse il sangue ferrarese,
e stanco chi âl pesasse a oncia a oncia,

che donerÃ  questo prete cortese
per mostrarsi di parte; e cotai doni
conformi fieno al viver del paese.

SÃ¹ sono specchi, voi dicete Troni,
onde refulge a noi Dio giudicante;
sÃ¬ che questi parlar ne paion buoniÂ».

Qui si tacette; e fecemi sembiante
che fosse ad altro volta, per la rota
in che si mise comâ era davante.

Lâaltra letizia, che mâera giÃ  nota
per cara cosa, mi si fece in vista
qual fin balasso in che lo sol percuota.

Per letiziar lÃ  sÃ¹ fulgor sâacquista,
sÃ¬ come riso qui; ma giÃ¹ sâabbuia
lâombra di fuor, come la mente Ã¨ trista.

Â«Dio vede tutto, e tuo veder sâinluiaÂ»,
dissâ io, Â«beato spirto, sÃ¬ che nulla
voglia di sÃ© a te puotâ esser fuia.

Dunque la voce tua, che âl ciel trastulla
sempre col canto di quei fuochi pii
che di sei ali facen la coculla,

perchÃ© non satisface aâ miei disii?
GiÃ  non attendereâ io tua dimanda,
sâio mâintuassi, come tu tâinmiiÂ».

Â«La maggior valle in che lâacqua si spandaÂ»,
incominciaro allor le sue parole,
Â«fuor di quel mar che la terra inghirlanda,

tra â discordanti liti contra âl sole
tanto sen va, che fa meridÃ¯ano
lÃ  dove lâorizzonte pria far suole.

Di quella valle fuâ io litorano
tra Ebro e Macra, che per cammin corto
parte lo Genovese dal Toscano.

Ad un occaso quasi e ad un orto
Buggea siede e la terra ondâ io fui,
che fÃ© del sangue suo giÃ  caldo il porto.

Folco mi disse quella gente a cui
fu noto il nome mio; e questo cielo
di me sâimprenta, comâ io feâ di lui;

chÃ© piÃ¹ non arse la figlia di Belo,
noiando e a Sicheo e a Creusa,
di me, infin che si convenne al pelo;

nÃ© quella RodopÃ«a che delusa
fu da Demofoonte, nÃ© Alcide
quando Iole nel core ebbe rinchiusa.

Non perÃ² qui si pente, ma si ride,
non de la colpa, châa mente non torna,
ma del valor châordinÃ² e provide.

Qui si rimira ne lâarte châaddorna
cotanto affetto, e discernesi âl bene
per che âl mondo di sÃ¹ quel di giÃ¹ torna.

Ma perchÃ© tutte le tue voglie piene
ten porti che son nate in questa spera,
proceder ancor oltre mi convene.

Tu vuoâ saper chi Ã¨ in questa lumera
che qui appresso me cosÃ¬ scintilla
come raggio di sole in acqua mera.

Or sappi che lÃ  entro si tranquilla
Raab; e a nostrâ ordine congiunta,
di lei nel sommo grado si sigilla.

Da questo cielo, in cui lâombra sâappunta
che âl vostro mondo face, pria châaltrâ alma
del trÃ¯unfo di Cristo fu assunta.

Ben si convenne lei lasciar per palma
in alcun cielo de lâalta vittoria
che sâacquistÃ² con lâuna e lâaltra palma,

perchâ ella favorÃ² la prima gloria
di IosÃ¼Ã¨ in su la Terra Santa,
che poco tocca al papa la memoria.

La tua cittÃ , che di colui Ã¨ pianta
che pria volse le spalle al suo fattore
e di cui Ã¨ la ânvidia tanto pianta,

perÃ² che fatto ha lupo del pastore.

Per questo lâEvangelio e i dottor magni

A questo intende il papa e â cardinali;

Paradiso Â· Canto X


Guardando nel suo Figlio con lâAmore
che lâuno e lâaltro etternalmente spira,
lo primo e ineffabile Valore

quanto per mente e per loco si gira
con tantâ ordine fÃ©, châesser non puote
sanza gustar di lui chi ciÃ² rimira.

Leva dunque, lettore, a lâalte rote
meco la vista, dritto a quella parte
dove lâun moto e lâaltro si percuote;

e lÃ¬ comincia a vagheggiar ne lâarte
di quel maestro che dentro a sÃ© lâama,
tanto che mai da lei lâocchio non parte.

Vedi come da indi si dirama
lâoblico cerchio che i pianeti porta,
per sodisfare al mondo che li chiama.

Che se la strada lor non fosse torta,
molta virtÃ¹ nel ciel sarebbe in vano,
e quasi ogne potenza qua giÃ¹ morta;

e se dal dritto piÃ¹ o men lontano
fosse âl partire, assai sarebbe manco
e giÃ¹ e sÃ¹ de lâordine mondano.

Or ti riman, lettor, sovra âl tuo banco,
dietro pensando a ciÃ² che si preliba,
sâesser vuoi lieto assai prima che stanco.

Messo tâho innanzi: omai per te ti ciba;
chÃ© a sÃ© torce tutta la mia cura
quella materia ondâ io son fatto scriba.

Lo ministro maggior de la natura,
che del valor del ciel lo mondo imprenta
e col suo lume il tempo ne misura,

con quella parte che sÃ¹ si rammenta
congiunto, si girava per le spire
in che piÃ¹ tosto ognora sâappresenta;

e io era con lui; ma del salire
non mâaccorsâ io, se non comâ uom sâaccorge,
anzi âl primo pensier, del suo venire.

Ã BÃ«atrice quella che sÃ¬ scorge
di bene in meglio, sÃ¬ subitamente
che lâatto suo per tempo non si sporge.

Quantâ esser convenia da sÃ© lucente
quel châera dentro al sol dovâ io entraâmi,
non per color, ma per lume parvente!

Perchâ io lo ângegno e lâarte e lâuso chiami,
sÃ¬ nol direi che mai sâimaginasse;
ma creder puossi e di veder si brami.

E se le fantasie nostre son basse
a tanta altezza, non Ã¨ maraviglia;
chÃ© sopra âl sol non fu occhio châandasse.

Tal era quivi la quarta famiglia
de lâalto Padre, che sempre la sazia,
mostrando come spira e come figlia.

E BÃ«atrice cominciÃ²: Â«Ringrazia,
ringrazia il Sol de li angeli, châa questo
sensibil tâha levato per sua graziaÂ».

Cor di mortal non fu mai sÃ¬ digesto
a divozione e a rendersi a Dio
con tutto âl suo gradir cotanto presto,

come a quelle parole mi fecâ io;
e sÃ¬ tutto âl mio amore in lui si mise,
che BÃ«atrice eclissÃ² ne lâoblio.

Non le dispiacque; ma sÃ¬ se ne rise,
che lo splendor de li occhi suoi ridenti
mia mente unita in piÃ¹ cose divise.

Io vidi piÃ¹ folgÃ³r vivi e vincenti
far di noi centro e di sÃ© far corona,
piÃ¹ dolci in voce che in vista lucenti:

cosÃ¬ cinger la figlia di Latona
vedem talvolta, quando lâaere Ã¨ pregno,
sÃ¬ che ritenga il fil che fa la zona.

Ne la corte del cielo, ondâ io rivegno,
si trovan molte gioie care e belle
tanto che non si posson trar del regno;

e âl canto di quei lumi era di quelle;
chi non sâimpenna sÃ¬ che lÃ  sÃ¹ voli,
dal muto aspetti quindi le novelle.

Poi, sÃ¬ cantando, quelli ardenti soli
si fuor girati intorno a noi tre volte,
come stelle vicine aâ fermi poli,

donne mi parver, non da ballo sciolte,
ma che sâarrestin tacite, ascoltando
fin che le nove note hanno ricolte.

E dentro a lâun sentiâ cominciar: Â«Quando
lo raggio de la grazia, onde sâaccende
verace amore e che poi cresce amando,

multiplicato in te tanto resplende,
che ti conduce su per quella scala
uâ sanza risalir nessun discende;

qual ti negasse il vin de la sua fiala
per la tua sete, in libertÃ  non fora
se non comâ acqua châal mar non si cala.

Tu vuoâ saper di quai piante sâinfiora
questa ghirlanda che ântorno vagheggia
la bella donna châal ciel tâavvalora.

Io fui de li agni de la santa greggia
che Domenico mena per cammino
uâ ben sâimpingua se non si vaneggia.

Questi che mâÃ¨ a destra piÃ¹ vicino,
frate e maestro fummi, ed esso Alberto
Ã¨ di Cologna, e io Thomas dâAquino.

Se sÃ¬ di tutti li altri esser vuoâ certo,
di retro al mio parlar ten vien col viso
girando su per lo beato serto.

Quellâ altro fiammeggiare esce del riso
di GrazÃ¯an, che lâuno e lâaltro foro
aiutÃ² sÃ¬ che piace in paradiso.

Lâaltro châappresso addorna il nostro coro,
quel Pietro fu che con la poverella
offerse a Santa Chiesa suo tesoro.

La quinta luce, châÃ¨ tra noi piÃ¹ bella,
spira di tale amor, che tutto âl mondo
lÃ  giÃ¹ ne gola di saper novella:

entro vâÃ¨ lâalta mente uâ sÃ¬ profondo
saver fu messo, che, se âl vero Ã¨ vero,
a veder tanto non surse il secondo.

Appresso vedi il lume di quel cero
che giÃ¹ in carne piÃ¹ a dentro vide
lâangelica natura e âl ministero.

Ne lâaltra piccioletta luce ride
quello avvocato deâ tempi cristiani
del cui latino Augustin si provide.

Or se tu lâocchio de la mente trani
di luce in luce dietro a le mie lode,
giÃ  de lâottava con sete rimani.

Per vedere ogne ben dentro vi gode
lâanima santa che âl mondo fallace
fa manifesto a chi di lei ben ode.

Lo corpo ondâ ella fu cacciata giace
giuso in Cieldauro; ed essa da martiro
e da essilio venne a questa pace.

Vedi oltre fiammeggiar lâardente spiro
dâIsidoro, di Beda e di Riccardo,
che a considerar fu piÃ¹ che viro.

Questi onde a me ritorna il tuo riguardo,
Ã¨ âl lume dâuno spirto che ân pensieri
gravi a morir li parve venir tardo:

essa Ã¨ la luce etterna di Sigieri,
che, leggendo nel Vico de li Strami,
silogizzÃ² invidÃ¯osi veriÂ».

Indi, come orologio che ne chiami
ne lâora che la sposa di Dio surge
a mattinar lo sposo perchÃ© lâami,

che lâuna parte e lâaltra tira e urge,
tin tin sonando con sÃ¬ dolce nota,
che âl ben disposto spirto dâamor turge;

cosÃ¬ vidâ Ã¯o la gloriosa rota
muoversi e render voce a voce in tempra
e in dolcezza châesser non pÃ² nota

se non colÃ  dove gioir sâinsempra.



Paradiso Â· Canto XI


O insensata cura deâ mortali,
quanto son difettivi silogismi
quei che ti fanno in basso batter lâali!

Chi dietro a iura e chi ad amforismi
sen giva, e chi seguendo sacerdozio,
e chi regnar per forza o per sofismi,

e chi rubare e chi civil negozio,
chi nel diletto de la carne involto
sâaffaticava e chi si dava a lâozio,

quando, da tutte queste cose sciolto,
con BÃ«atrice mâera suso in cielo
cotanto glorÃ¯osamente accolto.

Poi che ciascuno fu tornato ne lo
punto del cerchio in che avanti sâera,
fermossi, come a candellier candelo.

E io sentiâ dentro a quella lumera
che pria mâavea parlato, sorridendo
incominciar, faccendosi piÃ¹ mera:

Â«CosÃ¬ comâ io del suo raggio resplendo,
sÃ¬, riguardando ne la luce etterna,
li tuoi pensieri onde cagioni apprendo.

Tu dubbi, e hai voler che si ricerna
in sÃ¬ aperta e ân sÃ¬ distesa lingua
lo dicer mio, châal tuo sentir si sterna,

ove dinanzi dissi: âUâ ben sâimpinguaâ,
e lÃ  uâ dissi: âNon nacque il secondoâ;
e qui Ã¨ uopo che ben si distingua.

La provedenza, che governa il mondo
con quel consiglio nel quale ogne aspetto
creato Ã¨ vinto pria che vada al fondo,

perÃ² che andasse verâ lo suo diletto
la sposa di colui châad alte grida
disposÃ² lei col sangue benedetto,

in sÃ© sicura e anche a lui piÃ¹ fida,
due principi ordinÃ² in suo favore,
che quinci e quindi le fosser per guida.

Lâun fu tutto serafico in ardore;
lâaltro per sapÃ¯enza in terra fue
di cherubica luce uno splendore.

De lâun dirÃ², perÃ² che dâamendue
si dice lâun pregiando, qual châom prende,
perchâ ad un fine fur lâopere sue.

Intra Tupino e lâacqua che discende
del colle eletto dal beato Ubaldo,
fertile costa dâalto monte pende,

onde Perugia sente freddo e caldo
da Porta Sole; e di rietro le piange
per grave giogo Nocera con Gualdo.

Di questa costa, lÃ  dovâ ella frange
piÃ¹ sua rattezza, nacque al mondo un sole,
come fa questo talvolta di Gange.

PerÃ² chi dâesso loco fa parole,
non dica Ascesi, chÃ© direbbe corto,
ma OrÃ¯ente, se proprio dir vuole.

Non era ancor molto lontan da lâorto,
châel cominciÃ² a far sentir la terra
de la sua gran virtute alcun conforto;

chÃ© per tal donna, giovinetto, in guerra
del padre corse, a cui, come a la morte,
la porta del piacer nessun diserra;

e dinanzi a la sua spirital corte
et coram patre le si fece unito;
poscia di dÃ¬ in dÃ¬ lâamÃ² piÃ¹ forte.

Questa, privata del primo marito,
millecentâ anni e piÃ¹ dispetta e scura
fino a costui si stette sanza invito;

nÃ© valse udir che la trovÃ² sicura
con Amiclate, al suon de la sua voce,
colui châa tutto âl mondo fÃ© paura;

nÃ© valse esser costante nÃ© feroce,
sÃ¬ che, dove Maria rimase giuso,
ella con Cristo pianse in su la croce.

Ma perchâ io non proceda troppo chiuso,
Francesco e PovertÃ  per questi amanti
prendi oramai nel mio parlar diffuso.

La lor concordia e i lor lieti sembianti,
amore e maraviglia e dolce sguardo
facieno esser cagion di pensier santi;

tanto che âl venerabile Bernardo
si scalzÃ² prima, e dietro a tanta pace
corse e, correndo, li parve esser tardo.

Oh ignota ricchezza! oh ben ferace!
Scalzasi Egidio, scalzasi Silvestro
dietro a lo sposo, sÃ¬ la sposa piace.

Indi sen va quel padre e quel maestro
con la sua donna e con quella famiglia
che giÃ  legava lâumile capestro.

NÃ© li gravÃ² viltÃ  di cuor le ciglia
per esser fiâ di Pietro Bernardone,
nÃ© per parer dispetto a maraviglia;

ma regalmente sua dura intenzione
ad Innocenzio aperse, e da lui ebbe
primo sigillo a sua religÃ¯one.

Poi che la gente poverella crebbe
dietro a costui, la cui mirabil vita
meglio in gloria del ciel si canterebbe,

di seconda corona redimita
fu per Onorio da lâEtterno Spiro
la santa voglia dâesto archimandrita.

E poi che, per la sete del martiro,
ne la presenza del Soldan superba
predicÃ² Cristo e li altri che âl seguiro,

e per trovare a conversione acerba
troppo la gente e per non stare indarno,
redissi al frutto de lâitalica erba,

nel crudo sasso intra Tevero e Arno
da Cristo prese lâultimo sigillo,
che le sue membra due anni portarno.

Quando a colui châa tanto ben sortillo
piacque di trarlo suso a la mercede
châel meritÃ² nel suo farsi pusillo,

aâ frati suoi, sÃ¬ comâ a giuste rede,
raccomandÃ² la donna sua piÃ¹ cara,
e comandÃ² che lâamassero a fede;

e del suo grembo lâanima preclara
mover si volle, tornando al suo regno,
e al suo corpo non volle altra bara.

Pensa oramai qual fu colui che degno
collega fu a mantener la barca
di Pietro in alto mar per dritto segno;

e questo fu il nostro patrÃ¯arca;
per che qual segue lui, comâ el comanda,
discerner puoi che buone merce carca.

Ma âl suo pecuglio di nova vivanda
Ã¨ fatto ghiotto, sÃ¬ châesser non puote
che per diversi salti non si spanda;

e quanto le sue pecore remote
e vagabunde piÃ¹ da esso vanno,
piÃ¹ tornano a lâovil di latte vÃ²te.

Ben son di quelle che temono âl danno
e stringonsi al pastor; ma son sÃ¬ poche,
che le cappe fornisce poco panno.

Or, se le mie parole non son fioche,
se la tua audÃ¯enza Ã¨ stata attenta,
se ciÃ² châÃ¨ detto a la mente revoche,

in parte fia la tua voglia contenta,
perchÃ© vedrai la pianta onde si scheggia,
e vedraâ il corrÃ¨gger che argomenta

âUâ ben sâimpingua, se non si vaneggiaâÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XII


SÃ¬ tosto come lâultima parola
la benedetta fiamma per dir tolse,
a rotar cominciÃ² la santa mola;

e nel suo giro tutta non si volse
prima châunâaltra di cerchio la chiuse,
e moto a moto e canto a canto colse;

canto che tanto vince nostre muse,
nostre serene in quelle dolci tube,
quanto primo splendor quel châeâ refuse.

Come si volgon per tenera nube
due archi paralelli e concolori,
quando Iunone a sua ancella iube,

nascendo di quel dâentro quel di fori,
a guisa del parlar di quella vaga
châamor consunse come sol vapori,

e fanno qui la gente esser presaga,
per lo patto che Dio con NoÃ¨ puose,
del mondo che giÃ  mai piÃ¹ non sâallaga:

cosÃ¬ di quelle sempiterne rose
volgiensi circa noi le due ghirlande,
e sÃ¬ lâestrema a lâintima rispuose.

Poi che âl tripudio e lâaltra festa grande,
sÃ¬ del cantare e sÃ¬ del fiammeggiarsi
luce con luce gaudÃ¯ose e blande,

insieme a punto e a voler quetarsi,
pur come li occhi châal piacer che i move
conviene insieme chiudere e levarsi;

del cor de lâuna de le luci nove
si mosse voce, che lâago a la stella
parer mi fece in volgermi al suo dove;

e cominciÃ²: Â«Lâamor che mi fa bella
mi tragge a ragionar de lâaltro duca
per cui del mio sÃ¬ ben ci si favella.

Degno Ã¨ che, dovâ Ã¨ lâun, lâaltro sâinduca:
sÃ¬ che, comâ elli ad una militaro,
cosÃ¬ la gloria loro insieme luca.

Lâessercito di Cristo, che sÃ¬ caro
costÃ² a rÃ¯armar, dietro a la ânsegna
si movea tardo, sospeccioso e raro,

quando lo âmperador che sempre regna
provide a la milizia, châera in forse,
per sola grazia, non per esser degna;

e, come Ã¨ detto, a sua sposa soccorse
con due campioni, al cui fare, al cui dire
lo popol disvÃ¯ato si raccorse.

In quella parte ove surge ad aprire
Zefiro dolce le novelle fronde
di che si vede Europa rivestire,

non molto lungi al percuoter de lâonde
dietro a le quali, per la lunga foga,
lo sol talvolta ad ogne uom si nasconde,

siede la fortunata Calaroga
sotto la protezion del grande scudo
in che soggiace il leone e soggioga:

dentro vi nacque lâamoroso drudo
de la fede cristiana, il santo atleta
benigno aâ suoi e aâ nemici crudo;

e come fu creata, fu repleta
sÃ¬ la sua mente di viva vertute
che, ne la madre, lei fece profeta.

Poi che le sponsalizie fuor compiute
al sacro fonte intra lui e la Fede,
uâ si dotar di mutÃ¼a salute,

la donna che per lui lâassenso diede,
vide nel sonno il mirabile frutto
châuscir dovea di lui e de le rede;

e perchÃ© fosse qual era in costrutto,
quinci si mosse spirito a nomarlo
del possessivo di cui era tutto.

Domenico fu detto; e io ne parlo
sÃ¬ come de lâagricola che Cristo
elesse a lâorto suo per aiutarlo.

Ben parve messo e famigliar di Cristo:
che âl primo amor che ân lui fu manifesto,
fu al primo consiglio che diÃ¨ Cristo.

Spesse fÃ¯ate fu tacito e desto
trovato in terra da la sua nutrice,
come dicesse: âIo son venuto a questoâ.

Oh padre suo veramente Felice!
oh madre sua veramente Giovanna,
se, interpretata, val come si dice!

Non per lo mondo, per cui mo sâaffanna
di retro ad OstÃ¯ense e a Taddeo,
ma per amor de la verace manna

in picciol tempo gran dottor si feo;
tal che si mise a circÃ¼ir la vigna
che tosto imbianca, se âl vignaio Ã¨ reo.

E a la sedia che fu giÃ  benigna
piÃ¹ aâ poveri giusti, non per lei,
ma per colui che siede, che traligna,

non dispensare o due o tre per sei,
non la fortuna di prima vacante,
non decimas, quae sunt pauperum Dei,

addimandÃ², ma contro al mondo errante
licenza di combatter per lo seme
del qual ti fascian ventiquattro piante.

Poi, con dottrina e con volere insieme,
con lâofficio appostolico si mosse
quasi torrente châalta vena preme;

e ne li sterpi eretici percosse
lâimpeto suo, piÃ¹ vivamente quivi
dove le resistenze eran piÃ¹ grosse.

Di lui si fecer poi diversi rivi
onde lâorto catolico si riga,
sÃ¬ che i suoi arbuscelli stan piÃ¹ vivi.

Se tal fu lâuna rota de la biga
in che la Santa Chiesa si difese
e vinse in campo la sua civil briga,

ben ti dovrebbe assai esser palese
lâeccellenza de lâaltra, di cui Tomma
dinanzi al mio venir fu sÃ¬ cortese.

Ma lâorbita che fÃ© la parte somma
di sua circunferenza, Ã¨ derelitta,
sÃ¬ châÃ¨ la muffa dovâ era la gromma.

La sua famiglia, che si mosse dritta
coi piedi a le sue orme, Ã¨ tanto volta,
che quel dinanzi a quel di retro gitta;

e tosto si vedrÃ  de la ricolta
de la mala coltura, quando il loglio
si lagnerÃ  che lâarca li sia tolta.

Ben dico, chi cercasse a foglio a foglio
nostro volume, ancor troveria carta
uâ leggerebbe âIâ mi son quel châiâ soglioâ;

ma non fia da Casal nÃ© dâAcquasparta,
lÃ  onde vegnon tali a la scrittura,
châuno la fugge e altro la coarta.

Io son la vita di Bonaventura
da Bagnoregio, che neâ grandi offici
sempre pospuosi la sinistra cura.

Illuminato e Augustin son quici,
che fuor deâ primi scalzi poverelli
che nel capestro a Dio si fero amici.

Ugo da San Vittore Ã¨ qui con elli,
e Pietro Mangiadore e Pietro Spano,
lo qual giÃ¹ luce in dodici libelli;

NatÃ n profeta e âl metropolitano
Crisostomo e Anselmo e quel Donato
châa la primâ arte degnÃ² porre mano.

Rabano Ã¨ qui, e lucemi dallato
il calavrese abate Giovacchino
di spirito profetico dotato.

Ad inveggiar cotanto paladino
mi mosse lâinfiammata cortesia
di fra Tommaso e âl discreto latino;

e mosse meco questa compagniaÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XIII


Imagini, chi bene intender cupe
quel châiâ or vidiâe ritegna lâimage,
mentre châio dico, come ferma rupeâ,

quindici stelle che ân diverse plage
lo ciel avvivan di tanto sereno
che soperchia de lâaere ogne compage;

imagini quel carro a cuâ il seno
basta del nostro cielo e notte e giorno,
sÃ¬ châal volger del temo non vien meno;

imagini la bocca di quel corno
che si comincia in punta de lo stelo
a cui la prima rota va dintorno,

aver fatto di sÃ© due segni in cielo,
qual fece la figliuola di Minoi
allora che sentÃ¬ di morte il gelo;

e lâun ne lâaltro aver li raggi suoi,
e amendue girarsi per maniera
che lâuno andasse al primo e lâaltro al poi;

e avrÃ  quasi lâombra de la vera
costellazione e de la doppia danza
che circulava il punto dovâ io era:

poi châÃ¨ tanto di lÃ  da nostra usanza,
quanto di lÃ  dal mover de la Chiana
si move il ciel che tutti li altri avanza.

LÃ¬ si cantÃ² non Bacco, non Peana,
ma tre persone in divina natura,
e in una persona essa e lâumana.

CompiÃ© âl cantare e âl volger sua misura;
e attesersi a noi quei santi lumi,
felicitando sÃ© di cura in cura.

Ruppe il silenzio neâ concordi numi
poscia la luce in che mirabil vita
del poverel di Dio narrata fumi,

e disse: Â«Quando lâuna paglia Ã¨ trita,
quando la sua semenza Ã¨ giÃ  riposta,
a batter lâaltra dolce amor mâinvita.

Tu credi che nel petto onde la costa
si trasse per formar la bella guancia
il cui palato a tutto âl mondo costa,

e in quel che, forato da la lancia,
e prima e poscia tanto sodisfece,
che dâogne colpa vince la bilancia,

quantunque a la natura umana lece
aver di lume, tutto fosse infuso
da quel valor che lâuno e lâaltro fece;

e perÃ² miri a ciÃ² châio dissi suso,
quando narrai che non ebbe âl secondo
lo ben che ne la quinta luce Ã¨ chiuso.

Or apri li occhi a quel châio ti rispondo,
e vedrÃ¤i il tuo credere e âl mio dire
nel vero farsi come centro in tondo.

CiÃ² che non more e ciÃ² che puÃ² morire
non Ã¨ se non splendor di quella idea
che partorisce, amando, il nostro Sire;

chÃ© quella viva luce che sÃ¬ mea
dal suo lucente, che non si disuna
da lui nÃ© da lâamor châa lor sâintrea,

per sua bontate il suo raggiare aduna,
quasi specchiato, in nove sussistenze,
etternalmente rimanendosi una.

Quindi discende a lâultime potenze
giÃ¹ dâatto in atto, tanto divenendo,
che piÃ¹ non fa che brevi contingenze;

e queste contingenze essere intendo
le cose generate, che produce
con seme e sanza seme il ciel movendo.

La cera di costoro e chi la duce
non sta dâun modo; e perÃ² sotto âl segno
idÃ«ale poi piÃ¹ e men traluce.

Ondâ elli avvien châun medesimo legno,
secondo specie, meglio e peggio frutta;
e voi nascete con diverso ingegno.

Se fosse a punto la cera dedutta
e fosse il cielo in sua virtÃ¹ supprema,
la luce del suggel parrebbe tutta;

ma la natura la dÃ  sempre scema,
similemente operando a lâartista
châa lâabito de lâarte ha man che trema.

PerÃ² se âl caldo amor la chiara vista
de la prima virtÃ¹ dispone e segna,
tutta la perfezion quivi sâacquista.

CosÃ¬ fu fatta giÃ  la terra degna
di tutta lâanimal perfezÃ¯one;
cosÃ¬ fu fatta la Vergine pregna;

sÃ¬ châio commendo tua oppinÃ¯one,
che lâumana natura mai non fue
nÃ© fia qual fu in quelle due persone.

Or sâiâ non procedesse avanti piÃ¹e,
âDunque, come costui fu sanza pare?â
comincerebber le parole tue.

Ma perchÃ© paia ben ciÃ² che non pare,
pensa chi era, e la cagion che âl mosse,
quando fu detto âChiediâ, a dimandare.

Non ho parlato sÃ¬, che tu non posse
ben veder châel fu re, che chiese senno
acciÃ² che re sufficÃ¯ente fosse;

non per sapere il numero in che enno
li motor di qua sÃ¹, o se necesse
con contingente mai necesse fenno;

non si est dare primum motum esse,
o se del mezzo cerchio far si puote
trÃ¯angol sÃ¬ châun retto non avesse.

Onde, se ciÃ² châio dissi e questo note,
regal prudenza Ã¨ quel vedere impari
in che lo stral di mia intenzion percuote;

e se al âsurseâ drizzi li occhi chiari,
vedrai aver solamente respetto
ai regi, che son molti, e â buon son rari.

Con questa distinzion prendi âl mio detto;
e cosÃ¬ puote star con quel che credi
del primo padre e del nostro Diletto.

E questo ti sia sempre piombo aâ piedi,
per farti mover lento comâ uom lasso
e al sÃ¬ e al no che tu non vedi:

chÃ© quelli Ã¨ tra li stolti bene a basso,
che sanza distinzione afferma e nega
ne lâun cosÃ¬ come ne lâaltro passo;

perchâ elli âncontra che piÃ¹ volte piega
lâoppinÃ¯on corrente in falsa parte,
e poi lâaffetto lâintelletto lega.

Vie piÃ¹ che ândarno da riva si parte,
perchÃ© non torna tal qual eâ si move,
chi pesca per lo vero e non ha lâarte.

E di ciÃ² sono al mondo aperte prove
Parmenide, Melisso e Brisso e molti,
li quali andaro e non sapÃ«an dove;

sÃ¬ fÃ© Sabellio e Arrio e quelli stolti
che furon come spade a le Scritture
in render torti li diritti volti.

Non sien le genti, ancor, troppo sicure
a giudicar, sÃ¬ come quei che stima
le biade in campo pria che sien mature;

châiâ ho veduto tutto âl verno prima
lo prun mostrarsi rigido e feroce,
poscia portar la rosa in su la cima;

e legno vidi giÃ  dritto e veloce
correr lo mar per tutto suo cammino,
perire al fine a lâintrar de la foce.

Non creda donna Berta e ser Martino,
per vedere un furare, altro offerere,
vederli dentro al consiglio divino;

chÃ© quel puÃ² surgere, e quel puÃ² cadereÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XIV


Dal centro al cerchio, e sÃ¬ dal cerchio al centro
movesi lâacqua in un ritondo vaso,
secondo châÃ¨ percosso fuori o dentro:

ne la mia mente fÃ© sÃ¹bito caso
questo châio dico, sÃ¬ come si tacque
la glorÃ¯osa vita di Tommaso,

per la similitudine che nacque
del suo parlare e di quel di Beatrice,
a cui sÃ¬ cominciar, dopo lui, piacque:

Â«A costui fa mestieri, e nol vi dice
nÃ© con la voce nÃ© pensando ancora,
dâun altro vero andare a la radice.

Diteli se la luce onde sâinfiora
vostra sustanza, rimarrÃ  con voi
etternalmente sÃ¬ comâ ellâ Ã¨ ora;

e se rimane, dite come, poi
che sarete visibili rifatti,
esser porÃ  châal veder non vi nÃ²iÂ».

Come, da piÃ¹ letizia pinti e tratti,
a la fÃ¯ata quei che vanno a rota
levan la voce e rallegrano li atti,

cosÃ¬, a lâorazion pronta e divota,
li santi cerchi mostrar nova gioia
nel torneare e ne la mira nota.

Qual si lamenta perchÃ© qui si moia
per viver colÃ  sÃ¹, non vide quive
lo refrigerio de lâetterna ploia.

Quellâ uno e due e tre che sempre vive
e regna sempre in tre e ân due e ân uno,
non circunscritto, e tutto circunscrive,

tre volte era cantato da ciascuno
di quelli spirti con tal melodia,
châad ogne merto saria giusto muno.

E io udiâ ne la luce piÃ¹ dia
del minor cerchio una voce modesta,
forse qual fu da lâangelo a Maria,

risponder: Â«Quanto fia lunga la festa
di paradiso, tanto il nostro amore
si raggerÃ  dintorno cotal vesta.

La sua chiarezza sÃ©guita lâardore;
lâardor la visÃ¯one, e quella Ã¨ tanta,
quantâ ha di grazia sovra suo valore.

Come la carne glorÃ¯osa e santa
fia rivestita, la nostra persona
piÃ¹ grata fia per esser tutta quanta;

per che sâaccrescerÃ  ciÃ² che ne dona
di gratÃ¼ito lume il sommo bene,
lume châa lui veder ne condiziona;

onde la visÃ¯on crescer convene,
crescer lâardor che di quella sâaccende,
crescer lo raggio che da esso vene.

Ma sÃ¬ come carbon che fiamma rende,
e per vivo candor quella soverchia,
sÃ¬ che la sua parvenza si difende;

cosÃ¬ questo folgÃ³r che giÃ  ne cerchia
fia vinto in apparenza da la carne
che tutto dÃ¬ la terra ricoperchia;

nÃ© potrÃ  tanta luce affaticarne:
chÃ© li organi del corpo saran forti
a tutto ciÃ² che potrÃ  dilettarneÂ».

Tanto mi parver sÃ¹biti e accorti
e lâuno e lâaltro coro a dicer Â«Amme!Â»,
che ben mostrar disio dâi corpi morti:

forse non pur per lor, ma per le mamme,
per li padri e per li altri che fuor cari
anzi che fosser sempiterne fiamme.

Ed ecco intorno, di chiarezza pari,
nascere un lustro sopra quel che vâera,
per guisa dâorizzonte che rischiari.

E sÃ¬ come al salir di prima sera
comincian per lo ciel nove parvenze,
sÃ¬ che la vista pare e non par vera,

parvemi lÃ¬ novelle sussistenze
cominciare a vedere, e fare un giro
di fuor da lâaltre due circunferenze.

Oh vero sfavillar del Santo Spiro!
come si fece sÃ¹bito e candente
a li occhi miei che, vinti, nol soffriro!

Ma BÃ«atrice sÃ¬ bella e ridente
mi si mostrÃ², che tra quelle vedute
si vuol lasciar che non seguir la mente.

Quindi ripreser li occhi miei virtute
a rilevarsi; e vidimi translato
sol con mia donna in piÃ¹ alta salute.

Ben mâaccorsâ io châio era piÃ¹ levato,
per lâaffocato riso de la stella,
che mi parea piÃ¹ roggio che lâusato.

Con tutto âl core e con quella favella
châÃ¨ una in tutti, a Dio feci olocausto,
qual conveniesi a la grazia novella.

E non erâ anco del mio petto essausto
lâardor del sacrificio, châio conobbi
esso litare stato accetto e fausto;

chÃ© con tanto lucore e tanto robbi
mâapparvero splendor dentro a due raggi,
châio dissi: Â«O ElÃ¯Ã²s che sÃ¬ li addobbi!Â».

Come distinta da minori e maggi
lumi biancheggia tra â poli del mondo
Galassia sÃ¬, che fa dubbiar ben saggi;

sÃ¬ costellati facean nel profondo
Marte quei raggi il venerabil segno
che fan giunture di quadranti in tondo.

Qui vince la memoria mia lo ângegno;
chÃ© quella croce lampeggiava Cristo,
sÃ¬ châio non so trovare essempro degno;

ma chi prende sua croce e segue Cristo,
ancor mi scuserÃ  di quel châio lasso,
vedendo in quellâ albor balenar Cristo.

Di corno in corno e tra la cima e âl basso
si movien lumi, scintillando forte
nel congiugnersi insieme e nel trapasso:

cosÃ¬ si veggion qui diritte e torte,
veloci e tarde, rinovando vista,
le minuzie dâi corpi, lunghe e corte,

moversi per lo raggio onde si lista
talvolta lâombra che, per sua difesa,
la gente con ingegno e arte acquista.

E come giga e arpa, in tempra tesa
di molte corde, fa dolce tintinno
a tal da cui la nota non Ã¨ intesa,

cosÃ¬ daâ lumi che lÃ¬ mâapparinno
sâaccogliea per la croce una melode
che mi rapiva, sanza intender lâinno.

Ben mâaccorsâ io châelli era dâalte lode,
perÃ² châa me venÃ¬a Â«ResurgiÂ» e Â«VinciÂ»
come a colui che non intende e ode.

Ão mâinnamorava tanto quinci,
che ânfino a lÃ¬ non fu alcuna cosa
che mi legasse con sÃ¬ dolci vinci.

Forse la mia parola par troppo osa,
posponendo il piacer de li occhi belli,
neâ quai mirando mio disio ha posa;

ma chi sâavvede che i vivi suggelli
dâogne bellezza piÃ¹ fanno piÃ¹ suso,
e châio non mâera lÃ¬ rivolto a quelli,

escusar puommi di quel châio mâaccuso
per escusarmi, e vedermi dir vero:
chÃ© âl piacer santo non Ã¨ qui dischiuso,

perchÃ© si fa, montando, piÃ¹ sincero.



Paradiso Â· Canto XV


Benigna volontade in che si liqua
sempre lâamor che drittamente spira,
come cupiditÃ  fa ne la iniqua,

silenzio puose a quella dolce lira,
e fece quÃ¯etar le sante corde
che la destra del cielo allenta e tira.

Come saranno aâ giusti preghi sorde
quelle sustanze che, per darmi voglia
châio le pregassi, a tacer fur concorde?

Bene Ã¨ che sanza termine si doglia
chi, per amor di cosa che non duri
etternalmente, quello amor si spoglia.

Quale per li seren tranquilli e puri
discorre ad ora ad or sÃ¹bito foco,
movendo li occhi che stavan sicuri,

e pare stella che tramuti loco,
se non che da la parte ondâ eâ sâaccende
nulla sen perde, ed esso dura poco:

tale dal corno che ân destro si stende
a piÃ¨ di quella croce corse un astro
de la costellazion che lÃ¬ resplende;

nÃ© si partÃ¬ la gemma dal suo nastro,
ma per la lista radÃ¯al trascorse,
che parve foco dietro ad alabastro.

SÃ¬ pÃ¯a lâombra dâAnchise si porse,
se fede merta nostra maggior musa,
quando in Eliso del figlio sâaccorse.

Â«O sanguis meus, o superinfusa
gratÃ¯a DeÃ¯, sicut tibi cui
bis unquam celi ianÃ¼a reclusa?Â».

CosÃ¬ quel lume: ondâ io mâattesi a lui;
poscia rivolsi a la mia donna il viso,
e quinci e quindi stupefatto fui;

chÃ© dentro a li occhi suoi ardeva un riso
tal, châio pensai coâ miei toccar lo fondo
de la mia gloria e del mio paradiso.

Indi, a udire e a veder giocondo,
giunse lo spirto al suo principio cose,
châio non lo ântesi, sÃ¬ parlÃ² profondo;

nÃ© per elezÃ¯on mi si nascose,
ma per necessitÃ , chÃ© âl suo concetto
al segno dâi mortal si soprapuose.

E quando lâarco de lâardente affetto
fu sÃ¬ sfogato, che âl parlar discese
inverâ lo segno del nostro intelletto,

la prima cosa che per me sâintese,
Â«Benedetto sia tuÂ», fu, Â«trino e uno,
che nel mio seme seâ tanto cortese!Â».

E seguÃ¬: Â«Grato e lontano digiuno,
tratto leggendo del magno volume
duâ non si muta mai bianco nÃ© bruno,

solvuto hai, figlio, dentro a questo lume
in châio ti parlo, mercÃ¨ di colei
châa lâalto volo ti vestÃ¬ le piume.

Tu credi che a me tuo pensier mei
da quel châÃ¨ primo, cosÃ¬ come raia
da lâun, se si conosce, il cinque e âl sei;

e perÃ² châio mi sia e perchâ io paia
piÃ¹ gaudÃ¯oso a te, non mi domandi,
che alcun altro in questa turba gaia.

Tu credi âl vero; chÃ© i minori e â grandi
di questa vita miran ne lo speglio
in che, prima che pensi, il pensier pandi;

ma perchÃ© âl sacro amore in che io veglio
con perpetÃ¼a vista e che mâasseta
di dolce disÃ¯ar, sâadempia meglio,

la voce tua sicura, balda e lieta
suoni la volontÃ , suoni âl disio,
a che la mia risposta Ã¨ giÃ  decreta!Â».

Io mi volsi a Beatrice, e quella udio
pria châio parlassi, e arrisemi un cenno
che fece crescer lâali al voler mio.

Poi cominciai cosÃ¬: Â«Lâaffetto e âl senno,
come la prima equalitÃ  vâapparse,
dâun peso per ciascun di voi si fenno,

perÃ² che âl sol che vâallumÃ² e arse,
col caldo e con la luce Ã¨ sÃ¬ iguali,
che tutte simiglianze sono scarse.

Ma voglia e argomento neâ mortali,
per la cagion châa voi Ã¨ manifesta,
diversamente son pennuti in ali;

ondâ io, che son mortal, mi sento in questa
disagguaglianza, e perÃ² non ringrazio
se non col core a la paterna festa.

Ben supplico io a te, vivo topazio
che questa gioia prezÃ¯osa ingemmi,
perchÃ© mi facci del tuo nome sazioÂ».

Â«O fronda mia in che io compiacemmi
pur aspettando, io fui la tua radiceÂ»:
cotal principio, rispondendo, femmi.

Poscia mi disse: Â«Quel da cui si dice
tua cognazione e che centâ anni e piÃ¹e
girato ha âl monte in la prima cornice,

mio figlio fu e tuo bisavol fue:
ben si convien che la lunga fatica
tu li raccorci con lâopere tue.

Fiorenza dentro da la cerchia antica,
ondâ ella toglie ancora e terza e nona,
si stava in pace, sobria e pudica.

Non avea catenella, non corona,
non gonne contigiate, non cintura
che fosse a veder piÃ¹ che la persona.

Non faceva, nascendo, ancor paura
la figlia al padre, che âl tempo e la dote
non fuggien quinci e quindi la misura.

Non avea case di famiglia vÃ²te;
non vâera giunto ancor Sardanapalo
a mostrar ciÃ² che ân camera si puote.

Non era vinto ancora Montemalo
dal vostro Uccellatoio, che, comâ Ã¨ vinto
nel montar sÃ¹, cosÃ¬ sarÃ  nel calo.

Bellincion Berti vidâ io andar cinto
di cuoio e dâosso, e venir da lo specchio
la donna sua sanza âl viso dipinto;

e vidi quel dâi Nerli e quel del Vecchio
esser contenti a la pelle scoperta,
e le sue donne al fuso e al pennecchio.

Oh fortunate! ciascuna era certa
de la sua sepultura, e ancor nulla
era per Francia nel letto diserta.

Lâuna vegghiava a studio de la culla,
e, consolando, usava lâidÃ¯oma
che prima i padri e le madri trastulla;

lâaltra, traendo a la rocca la chioma,
favoleggiava con la sua famiglia
dâi Troiani, di Fiesole e di Roma.

Saria tenuta allor tal maraviglia
una Cianghella, un Lapo Salterello,
qual or saria Cincinnato e Corniglia.

A cosÃ¬ riposato, a cosÃ¬ bello
viver di cittadini, a cosÃ¬ fida
cittadinanza, a cosÃ¬ dolce ostello,

Maria mi diÃ¨, chiamata in alte grida;
e ne lâantico vostro Batisteo
insieme fui cristiano e Cacciaguida.

Moronto fu mio frate ed Eliseo;
mia donna venne a me di val di Pado,
e quindi il sopranome tuo si feo.

Poi seguitai lo âmperador Currado;
ed el mi cinse de la sua milizia,
tanto per bene ovrar li venni in grado.

Dietro li andai incontro a la nequizia
di quella legge il cui popolo usurpa,
per colpa dâi pastor, vostra giustizia.

Quivi fuâ io da quella gente turpa
disviluppato dal mondo fallace,
lo cui amor moltâ anime deturpa;

e venni dal martiro a questa paceÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XVI


O poca nostra nobiltÃ  di sangue,
se glorÃ¯ar di te la gente fai
qua giÃ¹ dove lâaffetto nostro langue,

mirabil cosa non mi sarÃ  mai:
chÃ© lÃ  dove appetito non si torce,
dico nel cielo, io me ne gloriai.

Ben seâ tu manto che tosto raccorce:
sÃ¬ che, se non sâappon di dÃ¬ in die,
lo tempo va dintorno con le force.

Dal âvoiâ che prima a Roma sâofferie,
in che la sua famiglia men persevra,
ricominciaron le parole mie;

onde Beatrice, châera un poco scevra,
ridendo, parve quella che tossio
al primo fallo scritto di Ginevra.

Io cominciai: Â«Voi siete il padre mio;
voi mi date a parlar tutta baldezza;
voi mi levate sÃ¬, châiâ son piÃ¹ châio.

Per tanti rivi sâempie dâallegrezza
la mente mia, che di sÃ© fa letizia
perchÃ© puÃ² sostener che non si spezza.

Ditemi dunque, cara mia primizia,
quai fuor li vostri antichi e quai fuor li anni
che si segnaro in vostra pÃ¼erizia;

ditemi de lâovil di San Giovanni
quanto era allora, e chi eran le genti
tra esso degne di piÃ¹ alti scanniÂ».

Come sâavviva a lo spirar dâi venti
carbone in fiamma, cosÃ¬ vidâ io quella
luce risplendere aâ miei blandimenti;

e come a li occhi miei si fÃ© piÃ¹ bella,
cosÃ¬ con voce piÃ¹ dolce e soave,
ma non con questa moderna favella,

dissemi: Â«Da quel dÃ¬ che fu detto âAveâ
al parto in che mia madre, châÃ¨ or santa,
sâallevÃ¯Ã² di me ondâ era grave,

al suo Leon cinquecento cinquanta
e trenta fiate venne questo foco
a rinfiammarsi sotto la sua pianta.

Li antichi miei e io nacqui nel loco
dove si truova pria lâultimo sesto
da quei che corre il vostro annÃ¼al gioco.

Basti dâi miei maggiori udirne questo:
chi ei si fosser e onde venner quivi,
piÃ¹ Ã¨ tacer che ragionare onesto.

Tutti color châa quel tempo eran ivi
da poter arme tra Marte e âl Batista,
eran il quinto di quei châor son vivi.

Ma la cittadinanza, châÃ¨ or mista
di Campi, di Certaldo e di Fegghine,
pura vediesi ne lâultimo artista.

Oh quanto fora meglio esser vicine
quelle genti châio dico, e al Galluzzo
e a Trespiano aver vostro confine,

che averle dentro e sostener lo puzzo
del villan dâAguglion, di quel da Signa,
che giÃ  per barattare ha lâocchio aguzzo!

Se la gente châal mondo piÃ¹ traligna
non fosse stata a Cesare noverca,
ma come madre a suo figlio benigna,

tal fatto Ã¨ fiorentino e cambia e merca,
che si sarebbe vÃ²lto a Simifonti,
lÃ  dove andava lâavolo a la cerca;

sariesi Montemurlo ancor deâ Conti;
sarieno i Cerchi nel piovier dâAcone,
e forse in Valdigrieve i Buondelmonti.

Sempre la confusion de le persone
principio fu del mal de la cittade,
come del vostro il cibo che sâappone;

e cieco toro piÃ¹ avaccio cade
che cieco agnello; e molte volte taglia
piÃ¹ e meglio una che le cinque spade.

Se tu riguardi Luni e Orbisaglia
come sono ite, e come se ne vanno
di retro ad esse Chiusi e Sinigaglia,

udir come le schiatte si disfanno
non ti parrÃ  nova cosa nÃ© forte,
poscia che le cittadi termine hanno.

Le vostre cose tutte hanno lor morte,
sÃ¬ come voi; ma celasi in alcuna
che dura molto, e le vite son corte.

E come âl volger del ciel de la luna
cuopre e discuopre i liti sanza posa,
cosÃ¬ fa di Fiorenza la Fortuna:

per che non dee parer mirabil cosa
ciÃ² châio dirÃ² de li alti Fiorentini
onde Ã¨ la fama nel tempo nascosa.

Io vidi li Ughi e vidi i Catellini,
Filippi, Greci, Ormanni e Alberichi,
giÃ  nel calare, illustri cittadini;

e vidi cosÃ¬ grandi come antichi,
con quel de la Sannella, quel de lâArca,
e Soldanieri e Ardinghi e Bostichi.

Sovra la porta châal presente Ã¨ carca
di nova fellonia di tanto peso
che tosto fia iattura de la barca,

erano i Ravignani, ondâ Ã¨ disceso
il conte Guido e qualunque del nome
de lâalto Bellincione ha poscia preso.

Quel de la Pressa sapeva giÃ  come
regger si vuole, e avea Galigaio
dorata in casa sua giÃ  lâelsa e âl pome.

Grandâ era giÃ  la colonna del Vaio,
Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifanti e Barucci
e Galli e quei châarrossan per lo staio.

Lo ceppo di che nacquero i Calfucci
era giÃ  grande, e giÃ  eran tratti
a le curule Sizii e Arrigucci.

Oh quali io vidi quei che son disfatti
per lor superbia! e le palle de lâoro
fiorian Fiorenza in tuttâ i suoi gran fatti.

CosÃ¬ facieno i padri di coloro
che, sempre che la vostra chiesa vaca,
si fanno grassi stando a consistoro.

Lâoltracotata schiatta che sâindraca
dietro a chi fugge, e a chi mostra âl dente
o ver la borsa, comâ agnel si placa,

giÃ  venÃ¬a sÃ¹, ma di picciola gente;
sÃ¬ che non piacque ad Ubertin Donato
che poÃ¯ il suocero il fÃ© lor parente.

GiÃ  era âl Caponsacco nel mercato
disceso giÃ¹ da Fiesole, e giÃ  era
buon cittadino Giuda e Infangato.

Io dirÃ² cosa incredibile e vera:
nel picciol cerchio sâentrava per porta
che si nomava da quei de la Pera.

Ciascun che de la bella insegna porta
del gran barone il cui nome e âl cui pregio
la festa di Tommaso riconforta,

da esso ebbe milizia e privilegio;
avvegna che con popol si rauni
oggi colui che la fascia col fregio.

GiÃ  eran Gualterotti e Importuni;
e ancor saria Borgo piÃ¹ quÃ¯eto,
se di novi vicin fosser digiuni.

La casa di che nacque il vostro fleto,
per lo giusto disdegno che vâha morti
e puose fine al vostro viver lieto,

era onorata, essa e suoi consorti:
o Buondelmonte, quanto mal fuggisti
le nozze sÃ¼e per li altrui conforti!

Molti sarebber lieti, che son tristi,
se Dio tâavesse conceduto ad Ema
la prima volta châa cittÃ  venisti.

Ma conveniesi a quella pietra scema
che guarda âl ponte, che Fiorenza fesse
vittima ne la sua pace postrema.

Con queste genti, e con altre con esse,
vidâ io Fiorenza in sÃ¬ fatto riposo,
che non avea cagione onde piangesse.

Con queste genti vidâio glorÃ¯oso
e giusto il popol suo, tanto che âl giglio
non era ad asta mai posto a ritroso,

nÃ© per divisÃ¯on fatto vermiglioÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XVII


Qual venne a ClimenÃ¨, per accertarsi
di ciÃ² châavÃ«a incontro a sÃ© udito,
quei châancor fa li padri ai figli scarsi;

tal era io, e tal era sentito
e da Beatrice e da la santa lampa
che pria per me avea mutato sito.

Per che mia donna Â«Manda fuor la vampa
del tuo disioÂ», mi disse, Â«sÃ¬ châella esca
segnata bene de la interna stampa:

non perchÃ© nostra conoscenza cresca
per tuo parlare, ma perchÃ© tâausi
a dir la sete, sÃ¬ che lâuom ti mescaÂ».

Â«O cara piota mia che sÃ¬ tâinsusi,
che, come veggion le terrene menti
non capere in trÃ¯angol due ottusi,

cosÃ¬ vedi le cose contingenti
anzi che sieno in sÃ©, mirando il punto
a cui tutti li tempi son presenti;

mentre châio era a Virgilio congiunto
su per lo monte che lâanime cura
e discendendo nel mondo defunto,

dette mi fuor di mia vita futura
parole gravi, avvegna châio mi senta
ben tetragono ai colpi di ventura;

per che la voglia mia saria contenta
dâintender qual fortuna mi sâappressa:
chÃ© saetta previsa vien piÃ¹ lentaÂ».

CosÃ¬ dissâ io a quella luce stessa
che pria mâavea parlato; e come volle
Beatrice, fu la mia voglia confessa.

NÃ© per ambage, in che la gente folle
giÃ  sâinviscava pria che fosse anciso
lâAgnel di Dio che le peccata tolle,

ma per chiare parole e con preciso
latin rispuose quello amor paterno,
chiuso e parvente del suo proprio riso:

Â«La contingenza, che fuor del quaderno
de la vostra matera non si stende,
tutta Ã¨ dipinta nel cospetto etterno;

necessitÃ  perÃ² quindi non prende
se non come dal viso in che si specchia
nave che per torrente giÃ¹ discende.

Da indi, sÃ¬ come viene ad orecchia
dolce armonia da organo, mi viene
a vista il tempo che ti sâapparecchia.

Qual si partio Ipolito dâAtene
per la spietata e perfida noverca,
tal di Fiorenza partir ti convene.

Questo si vuole e questo giÃ  si cerca,
e tosto verrÃ  fatto a chi ciÃ² pensa
lÃ  dove Cristo tutto dÃ¬ si merca.

La colpa seguirÃ  la parte offensa
in grido, come suol; ma la vendetta
fia testimonio al ver che la dispensa.

Tu lascerai ogne cosa diletta
piÃ¹ caramente; e questo Ã¨ quello strale
che lâarco de lo essilio pria saetta.

Tu proverai sÃ¬ come sa di sale
lo pane altrui, e come Ã¨ duro calle
lo scendere e âl salir per lâaltrui scale.

E quel che piÃ¹ ti graverÃ  le spalle,
sarÃ  la compagnia malvagia e scempia
con la qual tu cadrai in questa valle;

che tutta ingrata, tutta matta ed empia
si farÃ  contrâ a te; ma, poco appresso,
ella, non tu, nâavrÃ  rossa la tempia.

Di sua bestialitate il suo processo
farÃ  la prova; sÃ¬ châa te fia bello
averti fatta parte per te stesso.

Lo primo tuo refugio e âl primo ostello
sarÃ  la cortesia del gran Lombardo
che ân su la scala porta il santo uccello;

châin te avrÃ  sÃ¬ benigno riguardo,
che del fare e del chieder, tra voi due,
fia primo quel che tra li altri Ã¨ piÃ¹ tardo.

Con lui vedrai colui che âmpresso fue,
nascendo, sÃ¬ da questa stella forte,
che notabili fier lâopere sue.

Non se ne son le genti ancora accorte
per la novella etÃ , chÃ© pur nove anni
son queste rote intorno di lui torte;

ma pria che âl Guasco lâalto Arrigo inganni,
parran faville de la sua virtute
in non curar dâargento nÃ© dâaffanni.

Le sue magnificenze conosciute
saranno ancora, sÃ¬ che â suoi nemici
non ne potran tener le lingue mute.

A lui tâaspetta e aâ suoi benefici;
per lui fia trasmutata molta gente,
cambiando condizion ricchi e mendici;

e porteraâne scritto ne la mente
di lui, e nol diraiÂ»; e disse cose
incredibili a quei che fier presente.

Poi giunse: Â«Figlio, queste son le chiose
di quel che ti fu detto; ecco le ânsidie
che dietro a pochi giri son nascose.

Non voâ perÃ² châaâ tuoi vicini invidie,
poscia che sâinfutura la tua vita
vie piÃ¹ lÃ  che âl punir di lor perfidieÂ».

Poi che, tacendo, si mostrÃ² spedita
lâanima santa di metter la trama
in quella tela châio le porsi ordita,

io cominciai, come colui che brama,
dubitando, consiglio da persona
che vede e vuol dirittamente e ama:

Â«Ben veggio, padre mio, sÃ¬ come sprona
lo tempo verso me, per colpo darmi
tal, châÃ¨ piÃ¹ grave a chi piÃ¹ sâabbandona;

per che di provedenza Ã¨ buon châio mâarmi,
sÃ¬ che, se loco mâÃ¨ tolto piÃ¹ caro,
io non perdessi li altri per miei carmi.

GiÃ¹ per lo mondo sanza fine amaro,
e per lo monte del cui bel cacume
li occhi de la mia donna mi levaro,

e poscia per lo ciel, di lume in lume,
ho io appreso quel che sâio ridico,
a molti fia sapor di forte agrume;

e sâio al vero son timido amico,
temo di perder viver tra coloro
che questo tempo chiameranno anticoÂ».

La luce in che rideva il mio tesoro
châio trovai lÃ¬, si fÃ© prima corusca,
quale a raggio di sole specchio dâoro;

indi rispuose: Â«CoscÃ¯enza fusca
o de la propria o de lâaltrui vergogna
pur sentirÃ  la tua parola brusca.

Ma nondimen, rimossa ogne menzogna,
tutta tua visÃ¯on fa manifesta;
e lascia pur grattar dovâ Ã¨ la rogna.

ChÃ© se la voce tua sarÃ  molesta
nel primo gusto, vital nodrimento
lascerÃ  poi, quando sarÃ  digesta.

Questo tuo grido farÃ  come vento,
che le piÃ¹ alte cime piÃ¹ percuote;
e ciÃ² non fa dâonor poco argomento.

PerÃ² ti son mostrate in queste rote,
nel monte e ne la valle dolorosa
pur lâanime che son di fama note,

che lâanimo di quel châode, non posa
nÃ© ferma fede per essempro châaia
la sua radice incognita e ascosa,

nÃ© per altro argomento che non paiaÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XVIII


GiÃ  si godeva solo del suo verbo
quello specchio beato, e io gustava
lo mio, temprando col dolce lâacerbo;

e quella donna châa Dio mi menava
disse: Â«Muta pensier; pensa châiâ sono
presso a colui châogne torto disgravaÂ».

Io mi rivolsi a lâamoroso suono
del mio conforto; e qual io allor vidi
ne li occhi santi amor, qui lâabbandono:

non perchâ io pur del mio parlar diffidi,
ma per la mente che non puÃ² redire
sovra sÃ© tanto, sâaltri non la guidi.

Tanto possâ io di quel punto ridire,
che, rimirando lei, lo mio affetto
libero fu da ogne altro disire,

fin che âl piacere etterno, che diretto
raggiava in BÃ«atrice, dal bel viso
mi contentava col secondo aspetto.

Vincendo me col lume dâun sorriso,
ella mi disse: Â«Volgiti e ascolta;
chÃ© non pur neâ miei occhi Ã¨ paradisoÂ».

Come si vede qui alcuna volta
lâaffetto ne la vista, sâelli Ã¨ tanto,
che da lui sia tutta lâanima tolta,

cosÃ¬ nel fiammeggiar del folgÃ³r santo,
a châio mi volsi, conobbi la voglia
in lui di ragionarmi ancora alquanto.

El cominciÃ²: Â«In questa quinta soglia
de lâalbero che vive de la cima
e frutta sempre e mai non perde foglia,

spiriti son beati, che giÃ¹, prima
che venissero al ciel, fuor di gran voce,
sÃ¬ châogne musa ne sarebbe opima.

PerÃ² mira neâ corni de la croce:
quello châio nomerÃ², lÃ¬ farÃ  lâatto
che fa in nube il suo foco veloceÂ».

Io vidi per la croce un lume tratto
dal nomar IosuÃ¨, comâ el si feo;
nÃ© mi fu noto il dir prima che âl fatto.

E al nome de lâalto Macabeo
vidi moversi un altro roteando,
e letizia era ferza del paleo.

CosÃ¬ per Carlo Magno e per Orlando
due ne seguÃ¬ lo mio attento sguardo,
comâ occhio segue suo falcon volando.

Poscia trasse Guiglielmo e Rinoardo
e âl duca Gottifredi la mia vista
per quella croce, e Ruberto Guiscardo.

Indi, tra lâaltre luci mota e mista,
mostrommi lâalma che mâavea parlato
qual era tra i cantor del cielo artista.

Io mi rivolsi dal mio destro lato
per vedere in Beatrice il mio dovere,
o per parlare o per atto, segnato;

e vidi le sue luci tanto mere,
tanto gioconde, che la sua sembianza
vinceva li altri e lâultimo solere.

E come, per sentir piÃ¹ dilettanza
bene operando, lâuom di giorno in giorno
sâaccorge che la sua virtute avanza,

sÃ¬ mâaccorsâ io che âl mio girare intorno
col cielo insieme avea cresciuto lâarco,
veggendo quel miracol piÃ¹ addorno.

E qual Ã¨ âl trasmutare in picciol varco
di tempo in bianca donna, quando âl volto
suo si discarchi di vergogna il carco,

tal fu ne li occhi miei, quando fui vÃ²lto,
per lo candor de la temprata stella
sesta, che dentro a sÃ© mâavea ricolto.

Io vidi in quella giovÃ¯al facella
lo sfavillar de lâamor che lÃ¬ era
segnare a li occhi miei nostra favella.

E come augelli surti di rivera,
quasi congratulando a lor pasture,
fanno di sÃ© or tonda or altra schiera,

sÃ¬ dentro ai lumi sante creature
volitando cantavano, e faciensi
or D, or I, or L in sue figure.

Prima, cantando, a sua nota moviensi;
poi, diventando lâun di questi segni,
un poco sâarrestavano e taciensi.

O diva PegasÃ«a che li ângegni
fai glorÃ¯osi e rendili longevi,
ed essi teco le cittadi e â regni,

illustrami di te, sÃ¬ châio rilevi
le lor figure comâ io lâho concette:
paia tua possa in questi versi brevi!

Mostrarsi dunque in cinque volte sette
vocali e consonanti; e io notai
le parti sÃ¬, come mi parver dette.

âDILIGITE IUSTITIAMâ, primai
fur verbo e nome di tutto âl dipinto;
âQUI IUDICATIS TERRAMâ, fur sezzai.

Poscia ne lâemme del vocabol quinto
rimasero ordinate; sÃ¬ che Giove
pareva argento lÃ¬ dâoro distinto.

E vidi scendere altre luci dove
era il colmo de lâemme, e lÃ¬ quetarsi
cantando, credo, il ben châa sÃ© le move.

Poi, come nel percuoter dâi ciocchi arsi
surgono innumerabili faville,
onde li stolti sogliono agurarsi,

resurger parver quindi piÃ¹ di mille
luci e salir, qual assai e qual poco,
sÃ¬ come âl sol che lâaccende sortille;

e quÃ¯etata ciascuna in suo loco,
la testa e âl collo dâunâaguglia vidi
rappresentare a quel distinto foco.

Quei che dipinge lÃ¬, non ha chi âl guidi;
ma esso guida, e da lui si rammenta
quella virtÃ¹ châÃ¨ forma per li nidi.

Lâaltra bÃ«atitudo, che contenta
pareva prima dâingigliarsi a lâemme,
con poco moto seguitÃ² la âmprenta.

O dolce stella, quali e quante gemme
mi dimostraro che nostra giustizia
effetto sia del ciel che tu ingemme!

Per châio prego la mente in che sâinizia
tuo moto e tua virtute, che rimiri
ondâ esce il fummo che âl tuo raggio vizia;

sÃ¬ châunâaltra fÃ¯ata omai sâadiri
del comperare e vender dentro al templo
che si murÃ² di segni e di martÃ¬ri.

O milizia del ciel cuâ io contemplo,
adora per color che sono in terra
tutti svÃ¯ati dietro al malo essemplo!

GiÃ  si solea con le spade far guerra;
ma or si fa togliendo or qui or quivi
lo pan che âl pÃ¯o Padre a nessun serra.

Ma tu che sol per cancellare scrivi,
pensa che Pietro e Paulo, che moriro
per la vigna che guasti, ancor son vivi.

Ben puoi tu dire: Â«Iâ ho fermo âl disiro
sÃ¬ a colui che volle viver solo
e che per salti fu tratto al martiro,

châio non conosco il pescator nÃ© PoloÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XIX


Parea dinanzi a me con lâali aperte
la bella image che nel dolce frui
liete facevan lâanime conserte;

parea ciascuna rubinetto in cui
raggio di sole ardesse sÃ¬ acceso,
che neâ miei occhi rifrangesse lui.

E quel che mi convien ritrar testeso,
non portÃ² voce mai, nÃ© scrisse incostro,
nÃ© fu per fantasia giÃ  mai compreso;

châio vidi e anche udiâ parlar lo rostro,
e sonar ne la voce e Â«ioÂ» e Â«mioÂ»,
quandâ era nel concetto e ânoiâ e ânostroâ.

E cominciÃ²: Â«Per esser giusto e pio
son io qui essaltato a quella gloria
che non si lascia vincere a disio;

e in terra lasciai la mia memoria
sÃ¬ fatta, che le genti lÃ¬ malvage
commendan lei, ma non seguon la storiaÂ».

CosÃ¬ un sol calor di molte brage
si fa sentir, come di molti amori
usciva solo un suon di quella image.

Ondâ io appresso: Â«O perpetÃ¼i fiori
de lâetterna letizia, che pur uno
parer mi fate tutti vostri odori,

solvetemi, spirando, il gran digiuno
che lungamente mâha tenuto in fame,
non trovandoli in terra cibo alcuno.

Ben so io che, se ân cielo altro reame
la divina giustizia fa suo specchio,
che âl vostro non lâapprende con velame.

Sapete come attento io mâapparecchio
ad ascoltar; sapete qual Ã¨ quello
dubbio che mâÃ¨ digiun cotanto vecchioÂ».

Quasi falcone châesce del cappello,
move la testa e con lâali si plaude,
voglia mostrando e faccendosi bello,

vidâ io farsi quel segno, che di laude
de la divina grazia era contesto,
con canti quai si sa chi lÃ  sÃ¹ gaude.

Poi cominciÃ²: Â«Colui che volse il sesto
a lo stremo del mondo, e dentro ad esso
distinse tanto occulto e manifesto,

non potÃ© suo valor sÃ¬ fare impresso
in tutto lâuniverso, che âl suo verbo
non rimanesse in infinito eccesso.

E ciÃ² fa certo che âl primo superbo,
che fu la somma dâogne creatura,
per non aspettar lume, cadde acerbo;

e quinci appar châogne minor natura
Ã¨ corto recettacolo a quel bene
che non ha fine e sÃ© con sÃ© misura.

Dunque vostra veduta, che convene
esser alcun deâ raggi de la mente
di che tutte le cose son ripiene,

non pÃ² da sua natura esser possente
tanto, che suo principio discerna
molto di lÃ  da quel che lâÃ¨ parvente.

PerÃ² ne la giustizia sempiterna
la vista che riceve il vostro mondo,
comâ occhio per lo mare, entro sâinterna;

che, ben che da la proda veggia il fondo,
in pelago nol vede; e nondimeno
Ã¨li, ma cela lui lâesser profondo.

Lume non Ã¨, se non vien dal sereno
che non si turba mai; anzi Ã¨ tenÃ¨bra
od ombra de la carne o suo veleno.

Assai tâÃ¨ mo aperta la latebra
che tâascondeva la giustizia viva,
di che facei question cotanto crebra;

chÃ© tu dicevi: âUn uom nasce a la riva
de lâIndo, e quivi non Ã¨ chi ragioni
di Cristo nÃ© chi legga nÃ© chi scriva;

e tutti suoi voleri e atti buoni
sono, quanto ragione umana vede,
sanza peccato in vita o in sermoni.

Muore non battezzato e sanza fede:
ovâ Ã¨ questa giustizia che âl condanna?
ovâ Ã¨ la colpa sua, se ei non crede?â.

Or tu chi seâ, che vuoâ sedere a scranna,
per giudicar di lungi mille miglia
con la veduta corta dâuna spanna?

Certo a colui che meco sâassottiglia,
se la Scrittura sovra voi non fosse,
da dubitar sarebbe a maraviglia.

Oh terreni animali! oh menti grosse!
La prima volontÃ , châÃ¨ da sÃ© buona,
da sÃ©, châÃ¨ sommo ben, mai non si mosse.

Cotanto Ã¨ giusto quanto a lei consuona:
nullo creato bene a sÃ© la tira,
ma essa, radÃ¯ando, lui cagionaÂ».

Quale sovresso il nido si rigira
poi câha pasciuti la cicogna i figli,
e come quel châÃ¨ pasto la rimira;

cotal si fece, e sÃ¬ levÃ¤i i cigli,
la benedetta imagine, che lâali
movea sospinte da tanti consigli.

Roteando cantava, e dicea: Â«Quali
son le mie note a te, che non le ântendi,
tal Ã¨ il giudicio etterno a voi mortaliÂ».

Poi si quetaro quei lucenti incendi
de lo Spirito Santo ancor nel segno
che fÃ© i Romani al mondo reverendi,

esso ricominciÃ²: Â«A questo regno
non salÃ¬ mai chi non credette ân Cristo,
nÃ© pria nÃ© poi châel si chiavasse al legno.

Ma vedi: molti gridan âCristo, Cristo!â,
che saranno in giudicio assai men prope
a lui, che tal che non conosce Cristo;

e tai Cristian dannerÃ  lâEtÃ¯Ã²pe,
quando si partiranno i due collegi,
lâuno in etterno ricco e lâaltro inÃ²pe.

Che poran dir li Perse aâ vostri regi,
come vedranno quel volume aperto
nel qual si scrivon tutti suoi dispregi?

LÃ¬ si vedrÃ , tra lâopere dâAlberto,
quella che tosto moverÃ  la penna,
per che âl regno di Praga fia diserto.

LÃ¬ si vedrÃ  il duol che sovra Senna
induce, falseggiando la moneta,
quel che morrÃ  di colpo di cotenna.

LÃ¬ si vedrÃ  la superbia châasseta,
che fa lo Scotto e lâInghilese folle,
sÃ¬ che non puÃ² soffrir dentro a sua meta.

Vedrassi la lussuria e âl viver molle
di quel di Spagna e di quel di Boemme,
che mai valor non conobbe nÃ© volle.

Vedrassi al Ciotto di Ierusalemme
segnata con un i la sua bontate,
quando âl contrario segnerÃ  un emme.

Vedrassi lâavarizia e la viltate
di quei che guarda lâisola del foco,
ove Anchise finÃ¬ la lunga etate;

e a dare ad intender quanto Ã¨ poco,
la sua scrittura fian lettere mozze,
che noteranno molto in parvo loco.

E parranno a ciascun lâopere sozze
del barba e del fratel, che tanto egregia
nazione e due corone han fatte bozze.

E quel di Portogallo e di Norvegia
lÃ¬ si conosceranno, e quel di Rascia
che male ha visto il conio di Vinegia.

Oh beata Ungheria, se non si lascia
piÃ¹ malmenare! e beata Navarra,
se sâarmasse del monte che la fascia!

E creder deâ ciascun che giÃ , per arra
di questo, NiccosÃ¯a e Famagosta
per la lor bestia si lamenti e garra,

che dal fianco de lâaltre non si scostaÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XX


Quando colui che tutto âl mondo alluma
de lâemisperio nostro sÃ¬ discende,
che âl giorno dâogne parte si consuma,

lo ciel, che sol di lui prima sâaccende,
subitamente si rifÃ  parvente
per molte luci, in che una risplende;

e questo atto del ciel mi venne a mente,
come âl segno del mondo e deâ suoi duci
nel benedetto rostro fu tacente;

perÃ² che tutte quelle vive luci,
vie piÃ¹ lucendo, cominciaron canti
da mia memoria labili e caduci.

O dolce amor che di riso tâammanti,
quanto parevi ardente in queâ flailli,
châavieno spirto sol di pensier santi!

Poscia che i cari e lucidi lapilli
ondâ io vidi ingemmato il sesto lume
puoser silenzio a li angelici squilli,

udir mi parve un mormorar di fiume
che scende chiaro giÃ¹ di pietra in pietra,
mostrando lâubertÃ  del suo cacume.

E come suono al collo de la cetra
prende sua forma, e sÃ¬ comâ al pertugio
de la sampogna vento che penÃ¨tra,

cosÃ¬, rimosso dâaspettare indugio,
quel mormorar de lâaguglia salissi
su per lo collo, come fosse bugio.

Fecesi voce quivi, e quindi uscissi
per lo suo becco in forma di parole,
quali aspettava il core ovâ io le scrissi.

Â«La parte in me che vede e pate il sole
ne lâaguglie mortaliÂ», incominciommi,
Â«or fisamente riguardar si vole,

perchÃ© dâi fuochi ondâ io figura fommi,
quelli onde lâocchio in testa mi scintilla,
eâ di tutti lor gradi son li sommi.

Colui che luce in mezzo per pupilla,
fu il cantor de lo Spirito Santo,
che lâarca traslatÃ² di villa in villa:

ora conosce il merto del suo canto,
in quanto effetto fu del suo consiglio,
per lo remunerar châÃ¨ altrettanto.

Dei cinque che mi fan cerchio per ciglio,
colui che piÃ¹ al becco mi sâaccosta,
la vedovella consolÃ² del figlio:

ora conosce quanto caro costa
non seguir Cristo, per lâesperÃ¯enza
di questa dolce vita e de lâopposta.

E quel che segue in la circunferenza
di che ragiono, per lâarco superno,
morte indugiÃ² per vera penitenza:

ora conosce che âl giudicio etterno
non si trasmuta, quando degno preco
fa crastino lÃ  giÃ¹ de lâodÃ¯erno.

Lâaltro che segue, con le leggi e meco,
sotto buona intenzion che fÃ© mal frutto,
per cedere al pastor si fece greco:

ora conosce come il mal dedutto
dal suo bene operar non li Ã¨ nocivo,
avvegna che sia âl mondo indi distrutto.

E quel che vedi ne lâarco declivo,
Guiglielmo fu, cui quella terra plora
che piagne Carlo e Federigo vivo:

ora conosce come sâinnamora
lo ciel del giusto rege, e al sembiante
del suo fulgore il fa vedere ancora.

Chi crederebbe giÃ¹ nel mondo errante
che RifÃ«o Troiano in questo tondo
fosse la quinta de le luci sante?

Ora conosce assai di quel che âl mondo
veder non puÃ² de la divina grazia,
ben che sua vista non discerna il fondoÂ».

Quale allodetta che ân aere si spazia
prima cantando, e poi tace contenta
de lâultima dolcezza che la sazia,

tal mi sembiÃ² lâimago de la âmprenta
de lâetterno piacere, al cui disio
ciascuna cosa qual ellâ Ã¨ diventa.

E avvegna châio fossi al dubbiar mio
lÃ¬ quasi vetro a lo color châel veste,
tempo aspettar tacendo non patio,

ma de la bocca, Â«Che cose son queste?Â»,
mi pinse con la forza del suo peso:
per châio di coruscar vidi gran feste.

Poi appresso, con lâocchio piÃ¹ acceso,
lo benedetto segno mi rispuose
per non tenermi in ammirar sospeso:

Â«Io veggio che tu credi queste cose
perchâ io le dico, ma non vedi come;
sÃ¬ che, se son credute, sono ascose.

Fai come quei che la cosa per nome
apprende ben, ma la sua quiditate
veder non puÃ² se altri non la prome.

Regnum celorum vÃ¯olenza pate
da caldo amore e da viva speranza,
che vince la divina volontate:

non a guisa che lâomo a lâom sobranza,
ma vince lei perchÃ© vuole esser vinta,
e, vinta, vince con sua beninanza.

La prima vita del ciglio e la quinta
ti fa maravigliar, perchÃ© ne vedi
la regÃ¯on de li angeli dipinta.

Dâi corpi suoi non uscir, come credi,
Gentili, ma Cristiani, in ferma fede
quel dâi passuri e quel dâi passi piedi.

ChÃ© lâuna de lo ânferno, uâ non si riede
giÃ  mai a buon voler, tornÃ² a lâossa;
e ciÃ² di viva spene fu mercede:

di viva spene, che mise la possa
neâ prieghi fatti a Dio per suscitarla,
sÃ¬ che potesse sua voglia esser mossa.

Lâanima glorÃ¯osa onde si parla,
tornata ne la carne, in che fu poco,
credette in lui che potÃ«a aiutarla;

e credendo sâaccese in tanto foco
di vero amor, châa la morte seconda
fu degna di venire a questo gioco.

Lâaltra, per grazia che da sÃ¬ profonda
fontana stilla, che mai creatura
non pinse lâocchio infino a la prima onda,

tutto suo amor lÃ  giÃ¹ pose a drittura:
per che, di grazia in grazia, Dio li aperse
lâocchio a la nostra redenzion futura;

ondâ ei credette in quella, e non sofferse
da indi il puzzo piÃ¹ del paganesmo;
e riprendiene le genti perverse.

Quelle tre donne li fur per battesmo
che tu vedesti da la destra rota,
dinanzi al battezzar piÃ¹ dâun millesmo.

O predestinazion, quanto remota
Ã¨ la radice tua da quelli aspetti
che la prima cagion non veggion tota!

E voi, mortali, tenetevi stretti
a giudicar: chÃ© noi, che Dio vedemo,
non conosciamo ancor tutti li eletti;

ed Ã¨nne dolce cosÃ¬ fatto scemo,
perchÃ© il ben nostro in questo ben sâaffina,
che quel che vole Iddio, e noi volemoÂ».

CosÃ¬ da quella imagine divina,
per farmi chiara la mia corta vista,
data mi fu soave medicina.

E come a buon cantor buon citarista
fa seguitar lo guizzo de la corda,
in che piÃ¹ di piacer lo canto acquista,

sÃ¬, mentre châeâ parlÃ², sÃ¬ mi ricorda
châio vidi le due luci benedette,
pur come batter dâocchi si concorda,

con le parole mover le fiammette.



Paradiso Â· Canto XXI


GiÃ  eran li occhi miei rifissi al volto
de la mia donna, e lâanimo con essi,
e da ogne altro intento sâera tolto.

E quella non ridea; ma Â«Sâio ridessiÂ»,
mi cominciÃ², Â«tu ti faresti quale
fu SemelÃ¨ quando di cener fessi:

chÃ© la bellezza mia, che per le scale
de lâetterno palazzo piÃ¹ sâaccende,
comâ hai veduto, quanto piÃ¹ si sale,

se non si temperasse, tanto splende,
che âl tuo mortal podere, al suo fulgore,
sarebbe fronda che trono scoscende.

Noi sem levati al settimo splendore,
che sotto âl petto del Leone ardente
raggia mo misto giÃ¹ del suo valore.

Ficca di retro a li occhi tuoi la mente,
e fa di quelli specchi a la figura
che ân questo specchio ti sarÃ  parventeÂ».

Qual savesse qual era la pastura
del viso mio ne lâaspetto beato
quandâ io mi trasmutai ad altra cura,

conoscerebbe quanto mâera a grato
ubidire a la mia celeste scorta,
contrapesando lâun con lâaltro lato.

Dentro al cristallo che âl vocabol porta,
cerchiando il mondo, del suo caro duce
sotto cui giacque ogne malizia morta,

di color dâoro in che raggio traluce
vidâ io uno scaleo eretto in suso
tanto, che nol seguiva la mia luce.

Vidi anche per li gradi scender giuso
tanti splendor, châio pensai châogne lume
che par nel ciel, quindi fosse diffuso.

E come, per lo natural costume,
le pole insieme, al cominciar del giorno,
si movono a scaldar le fredde piume;

poi altre vanno via sanza ritorno,
altre rivolgon sÃ© onde son mosse,
e altre roteando fan soggiorno;

tal modo parve me che quivi fosse
in quello sfavillar che ânsieme venne,
sÃ¬ come in certo grado si percosse.

E quel che presso piÃ¹ ci si ritenne,
si fÃ© sÃ¬ chiaro, châio dicea pensando:
âIo veggio ben lâamor che tu mâaccenne.

Ma quella ondâ io aspetto il come e âl quando
del dire e del tacer, si sta; ondâ io,
contra âl disio, fo ben châio non dimandoâ.

Per châella, che vedÃ«a il tacer mio
nel veder di colui che tutto vede,
mi disse: Â«Solvi il tuo caldo disioÂ».

E io incominciai: Â«La mia mercede
non mi fa degno de la tua risposta;
ma per colei che âl chieder mi concede,

vita beata che ti stai nascosta
dentro a la tua letizia, fammi nota
la cagion che sÃ¬ presso mi tâha posta;

e dÃ¬ perchÃ© si tace in questa rota
la dolce sinfonia di paradiso,
che giÃ¹ per lâaltre suona sÃ¬ divotaÂ».

Â«Tu hai lâudir mortal sÃ¬ come il visoÂ»,
rispuose a me; Â«onde qui non si canta
per quel che BÃ«atrice non ha riso.

GiÃ¹ per li gradi de la scala santa
discesi tanto sol per farti festa
col dire e con la luce che mi ammanta;

nÃ© piÃ¹ amor mi fece esser piÃ¹ presta,
chÃ© piÃ¹ e tanto amor quinci sÃ¹ ferve,
sÃ¬ come il fiammeggiar ti manifesta.

Ma lâalta caritÃ , che ci fa serve
pronte al consiglio che âl mondo governa,
sorteggia qui sÃ¬ come tu osserveÂ».

Â«Io veggio benÂ», dissâ io, Â«sacra lucerna,
come libero amore in questa corte
basta a seguir la provedenza etterna;

ma questo Ã¨ quel châa cerner mi par forte,
perchÃ© predestinata fosti sola
a questo officio tra le tue consorteÂ».

NÃ© venni prima a lâultima parola,
che del suo mezzo fece il lume centro,
girando sÃ© come veloce mola;

poi rispuose lâamor che vâera dentro:
Â«Luce divina sopra me sâappunta,
penetrando per questa in châio mâinventro,

la cui virtÃ¹, col mio veder congiunta,
mi leva sopra me tanto, châiâ veggio
la somma essenza de la quale Ã¨ munta.

Quinci vien lâallegrezza ondâ io fiammeggio;
per châa la vista mia, quantâ ella Ã¨ chiara,
la chiaritÃ  de la fiamma pareggio.

Ma quellâ alma nel ciel che piÃ¹ si schiara,
quel serafin che ân Dio piÃ¹ lâocchio ha fisso,
a la dimanda tua non satisfara,

perÃ² che sÃ¬ sâinnoltra ne lo abisso
de lâetterno statuto quel che chiedi,
che da ogne creata vista Ã¨ scisso.

E al mondo mortal, quando tu riedi,
questo rapporta, sÃ¬ che non presumma
a tanto segno piÃ¹ mover li piedi.

La mente, che qui luce, in terra fumma;
onde riguarda come puÃ² lÃ  giÃ¹e
quel che non pote perchÃ© âl ciel lâassummaÂ».

SÃ¬ mi prescrisser le parole sue,
châio lasciai la quistione e mi ritrassi
a dimandarla umilmente chi fue.

Â«Tra â due liti dâItalia surgon sassi,
e non molto distanti a la tua patria,
tanto che â troni assai suonan piÃ¹ bassi,

e fanno un gibbo che si chiama Catria,
di sotto al quale Ã¨ consecrato un ermo,
che suole esser disposto a sola latriaÂ».

CosÃ¬ ricominciommi il terzo sermo;
e poi, continÃ¼ando, disse: Â«Quivi
al servigio di Dio mi feâ sÃ¬ fermo,

che pur con cibi di liquor dâulivi
lievemente passava caldi e geli,
contento neâ pensier contemplativi.

Render solea quel chiostro a questi cieli
fertilemente; e ora Ã¨ fatto vano,
sÃ¬ che tosto convien che si riveli.

In quel loco fuâ io Pietro Damiano,
e Pietro Peccator fuâ ne la casa
di Nostra Donna in sul lito adriano.

Poca vita mortal mâera rimasa,
quando fui chiesto e tratto a quel cappello,
che pur di male in peggio si travasa.

Venne CefÃ s e venne il gran vasello
de lo Spirito Santo, magri e scalzi,
prendendo il cibo da qualunque ostello.

Or voglion quinci e quindi chi rincalzi
li moderni pastori e chi li meni,
tanto son gravi, e chi di rietro li alzi.

Cuopron dâi manti loro i palafreni,
sÃ¬ che due bestie van sottâ una pelle:
oh pazÃ¯enza che tanto sostieni!Â».

A questa voce vidâ io piÃ¹ fiammelle
di grado in grado scendere e girarsi,
e ogne giro le facea piÃ¹ belle.

Dintorno a questa vennero e fermarsi,
e fero un grido di sÃ¬ alto suono,
che non potrebbe qui assomigliarsi;

nÃ© io lo ântesi, sÃ¬ mi vinse il tuono.



Paradiso Â· Canto XXII


Oppresso di stupore, a la mia guida
mi volsi, come parvol che ricorre
sempre colÃ  dove piÃ¹ si confida;

e quella, come madre che soccorre
sÃ¹bito al figlio palido e anelo
con la sua voce, che âl suol ben disporre,

mi disse: Â«Non sai tu che tu seâ in cielo?
e non sai tu che âl cielo Ã¨ tutto santo,
e ciÃ² che ci si fa vien da buon zelo?

Come tâavrebbe trasmutato il canto,
e io ridendo, mo pensar lo puoi,
poscia che âl grido tâha mosso cotanto;

nel qual, se ânteso avessi i prieghi suoi,
giÃ  ti sarebbe nota la vendetta
che tu vedrai innanzi che tu muoi.

La spada di qua sÃ¹ non taglia in fretta
nÃ© tardo, maâ châal parer di colui
che disÃ¯ando o temendo lâaspetta.

Ma rivolgiti omai inverso altrui;
châassai illustri spiriti vedrai,
se comâ io dico lâaspetto reduiÂ».

Come a lei piacque, li occhi ritornai,
e vidi cento sperule che ânsieme
piÃ¹ sâabbellivan con mutÃ¼i rai.

Io stava come quei che ân sÃ© repreme
la punta del disio, e non sâattenta
di domandar, sÃ¬ del troppo si teme;

e la maggiore e la piÃ¹ luculenta
di quelle margherite innanzi fessi,
per far di sÃ© la mia voglia contenta.

Poi dentro a lei udiâ: Â«Se tu vedessi
comâ io la caritÃ  che tra noi arde,
li tuoi concetti sarebbero espressi.

Ma perchÃ© tu, aspettando, non tarde
a lâalto fine, io ti farÃ² risposta
pur al pensier, da che sÃ¬ ti riguarde.

Quel monte a cui Cassino Ã¨ ne la costa
fu frequentato giÃ  in su la cima
da la gente ingannata e mal disposta;

e quel son io che sÃ¹ vi portai prima
lo nome di colui che ân terra addusse
la veritÃ  che tanto ci soblima;

e tanta grazia sopra me relusse,
châio ritrassi le ville circunstanti
da lâempio cÃ³lto che âl mondo sedusse.

Questi altri fuochi tutti contemplanti
uomini fuoro, accesi di quel caldo
che fa nascere i fiori e â frutti santi.

Qui Ã¨ Maccario, qui Ã¨ Romoaldo,
qui son li frati miei che dentro ai chiostri
fermar li piedi e tennero il cor saldoÂ».

E io a lui: Â«Lâaffetto che dimostri
meco parlando, e la buona sembianza
châio veggio e noto in tutti li ardor vostri,

cosÃ¬ mâha dilatata mia fidanza,
come âl sol fa la rosa quando aperta
tanto divien quantâ ellâ ha di possanza.

PerÃ² ti priego, e tu, padre, mâaccerta
sâio posso prender tanta grazia, châio
ti veggia con imagine scovertaÂ».

Ondâ elli: Â«Frate, il tuo alto disio
sâadempierÃ  in su lâultima spera,
ove sâadempion tutti li altri e âl mio.

Ivi Ã¨ perfetta, matura e intera
ciascuna disÃ¯anza; in quella sola
Ã¨ ogne parte lÃ  ove semprâ era,

perchÃ© non Ã¨ in loco e non sâimpola;
e nostra scala infino ad essa varca,
onde cosÃ¬ dal viso ti sâinvola.

Infin lÃ  sÃ¹ la vide il patriarca
Iacobbe porger la superna parte,
quando li apparve dâangeli sÃ¬ carca.

Ma, per salirla, mo nessun diparte
da terra i piedi, e la regola mia
rimasa Ã¨ per danno de le carte.

Le mura che solieno esser badia
fatte sono spelonche, e le cocolle
sacca son piene di farina ria.

Ma grave usura tanto non si tolle
contra âl piacer di Dio, quanto quel frutto
che fa il cor deâ monaci sÃ¬ folle;

chÃ© quantunque la Chiesa guarda, tutto
Ã¨ de la gente che per Dio dimanda;
non di parenti nÃ© dâaltro piÃ¹ brutto.

La carne dâi mortali Ã¨ tanto blanda,
che giÃ¹ non basta buon cominciamento
dal nascer de la quercia al far la ghianda.

Pier cominciÃ² sanzâ oro e sanzâ argento,
e io con orazione e con digiuno,
e Francesco umilmente il suo convento;

e se guardi âl principio di ciascuno,
poscia riguardi lÃ  dovâ Ã¨ trascorso,
tu vederai del bianco fatto bruno.

Veramente Iordan vÃ²lto retrorso
piÃ¹ fu, e âl mar fuggir, quando Dio volse,
mirabile a veder che qui âl soccorsoÂ».

CosÃ¬ mi disse, e indi si raccolse
al suo collegio, e âl collegio si strinse;
poi, come turbo, in sÃ¹ tutto sâavvolse.

La dolce donna dietro a lor mi pinse
con un sol cenno su per quella scala,
sÃ¬ sua virtÃ¹ la mia natura vinse;

nÃ© mai qua giÃ¹ dove si monta e cala
naturalmente, fu sÃ¬ ratto moto
châagguagliar si potesse a la mia ala.

Sâio torni mai, lettore, a quel divoto
trÃ¯unfo per lo quale io piango spesso
le mie peccata e âl petto mi percuoto,

tu non avresti in tanto tratto e messo
nel foco il dito, in quantâ io vidi âl segno
che segue il Tauro e fui dentro da esso.

O glorÃ¯ose stelle, o lume pregno
di gran virtÃ¹, dal quale io riconosco
tutto, qual che si sia, il mio ingegno,

con voi nasceva e sâascondeva vosco
quelli châÃ¨ padre dâogne mortal vita,
quandâ io sentiâ di prima lâaere tosco;

e poi, quando mi fu grazia largita
dâentrar ne lâalta rota che vi gira,
la vostra regÃ¯on mi fu sortita.

A voi divotamente ora sospira
lâanima mia, per acquistar virtute
al passo forte che a sÃ© la tira.

Â«Tu seâ sÃ¬ presso a lâultima saluteÂ»,
cominciÃ² BÃ«atrice, Â«che tu dei
aver le luci tue chiare e acute;

e perÃ², prima che tu piÃ¹ tâinlei,
rimira in giÃ¹, e vedi quanto mondo
sotto li piedi giÃ  esser ti fei;

sÃ¬ che âl tuo cor, quantunque puÃ², giocondo
sâappresenti a la turba trÃ¯unfante
che lieta vien per questo etera tondoÂ».

Col viso ritornai per tutte quante
le sette spere, e vidi questo globo
tal, châio sorrisi del suo vil sembiante;

e quel consiglio per migliore approbo
che lâha per meno; e chi ad altro pensa
chiamar si puote veramente probo.

Vidi la figlia di Latona incensa
sanza quellâ ombra che mi fu cagione
per che giÃ  la credetti rara e densa.

Lâaspetto del tuo nato, IperÃ¯one,
quivi sostenni, e vidi comâ si move
circa e vicino a lui Maia e DÃ¯one.

Quindi mâapparve il temperar di Giove
tra âl padre e âl figlio; e quindi mi fu chiaro
il varÃ¯ar che fanno di lor dove;

e tutti e sette mi si dimostraro
quanto son grandi e quanto son veloci
e come sono in distante riparo.

Lâaiuola che ci fa tanto feroci,
volgendomâ io con li etterni Gemelli,
tutta mâapparve daâ colli a le foci;

poscia rivolsi li occhi a li occhi belli.



Paradiso Â· Canto XXIII


Come lâaugello, intra lâamate fronde,
posato al nido deâ suoi dolci nati
la notte che le cose ci nasconde,

che, per veder li aspetti disÃ¯ati
e per trovar lo cibo onde li pasca,
in che gravi labor li sono aggrati,

previene il tempo in su aperta frasca,
e con ardente affetto il sole aspetta,
fiso guardando pur che lâalba nasca;

cosÃ¬ la donna mÃ¯a stava eretta
e attenta, rivolta inverâ la plaga
sotto la quale il sol mostra men fretta:

sÃ¬ che, veggendola io sospesa e vaga,
fecimi qual Ã¨ quei che disÃ¯ando
altro vorria, e sperando sâappaga.

Ma poco fu tra uno e altro quando,
del mio attender, dico, e del vedere
lo ciel venir piÃ¹ e piÃ¹ rischiarando;

e BÃ«atrice disse: Â«Ecco le schiere
del trÃ¯unfo di Cristo e tutto âl frutto
ricolto del girar di queste spere!Â».

Pariemi che âl suo viso ardesse tutto,
e li occhi avea di letizia sÃ¬ pieni,
che passarmen convien sanza costrutto.

Quale neâ plenilunÃ¯i sereni
TrivÃ¯a ride tra le ninfe etterne
che dipingon lo ciel per tutti i seni,

vidâ iâ sopra migliaia di lucerne
un sol che tutte quante lâaccendea,
come fa âl nostro le viste superne;

e per la viva luce trasparea
la lucente sustanza tanto chiara
nel viso mio, che non la sostenea.

Oh BÃ«atrice, dolce guida e cara!
Ella mi disse: Â«Quel che ti sobranza
Ã¨ virtÃ¹ da cui nulla si ripara.

Quivi Ã¨ la sapÃ¯enza e la possanza
châaprÃ¬ le strade tra âl cielo e la terra,
onde fu giÃ  sÃ¬ lunga disÃ¯anzaÂ».

Come foco di nube si diserra
per dilatarsi sÃ¬ che non vi cape,
e fuor di sua natura in giÃ¹ sâatterra,

la mente mia cosÃ¬, tra quelle dape
fatta piÃ¹ grande, di sÃ© stessa uscÃ¬o,
e che si fesse rimembrar non sape.

Â«Apri li occhi e riguarda qual son io;
tu hai vedute cose, che possente
seâ fatto a sostener lo riso mioÂ».

Io era come quei che si risente
di visÃ¯one oblita e che sâingegna
indarno di ridurlasi a la mente,

quandâ io udiâ questa proferta, degna
di tanto grato, che mai non si stingue
del libro che âl preterito rassegna.

Se mo sonasser tutte quelle lingue
che PolimnÃ¯a con le suore fero
del latte lor dolcissimo piÃ¹ pingue,

per aiutarmi, al millesmo del vero
non si verria, cantando il santo riso
e quanto il santo aspetto facea mero;

e cosÃ¬, figurando il paradiso,
convien saltar lo sacrato poema,
come chi trova suo cammin riciso.

Ma chi pensasse il ponderoso tema
e lâomero mortal che se ne carca,
nol biasmerebbe se sottâ esso trema:

non Ã¨ pareggio da picciola barca
quel che fendendo va lâardita prora,
nÃ© da nocchier châa sÃ© medesmo parca.

Â«PerchÃ© la faccia mia sÃ¬ tâinnamora,
che tu non ti rivolgi al bel giardino
che sotto i raggi di Cristo sâinfiora?

Quivi Ã¨ la rosa in che âl verbo divino
carne si fece; quivi son li gigli
al cui odor si prese il buon camminoÂ».

CosÃ¬ Beatrice; e io, che aâ suoi consigli
tutto era pronto, ancora mi rendei
a la battaglia deâ debili cigli.

Come a raggio di sol, che puro mei
per fratta nube, giÃ  prato di fiori
vider, coverti dâombra, li occhi miei;

vidâ io cosÃ¬ piÃ¹ turbe di splendori,
folgorate di sÃ¹ da raggi ardenti,
sanza veder principio di folgÃ³ri.

O benigna vertÃ¹ che sÃ¬ li âmprenti,
sÃ¹ tâessaltasti, per largirmi loco
a li occhi lÃ¬ che non tâeran possenti.

Il nome del bel fior châio sempre invoco
e mane e sera, tutto mi ristrinse
lâanimo ad avvisar lo maggior foco;

e come ambo le luci mi dipinse
il quale e il quanto de la viva stella
che lÃ  sÃ¹ vince come qua giÃ¹ vinse,

per entro il cielo scese una facella,
formata in cerchio a guisa di corona,
e cinsela e girossi intorno ad ella.

Qualunque melodia piÃ¹ dolce suona
qua giÃ¹ e piÃ¹ a sÃ© lâanima tira,
parrebbe nube che squarciata tona,

comparata al sonar di quella lira
onde si coronava il bel zaffiro
del quale il ciel piÃ¹ chiaro sâinzaffira.

Â«Io sono amore angelico, che giro
lâalta letizia che spira del ventre
che fu albergo del nostro disiro;

e girerommi, donna del ciel, mentre
che seguirai tuo figlio, e farai dia
piÃ¹ la spera suprema perchÃ© lÃ¬ entreÂ».

CosÃ¬ la circulata melodia
si sigillava, e tutti li altri lumi
facean sonare il nome di Maria.

Lo real manto di tutti i volumi
del mondo, che piÃ¹ ferve e piÃ¹ sâavviva
ne lâalito di Dio e nei costumi,

avea sopra di noi lâinterna riva
tanto distante, che la sua parvenza,
lÃ  dovâ io era, ancor non appariva:

perÃ² non ebber li occhi miei potenza
di seguitar la coronata fiamma
che si levÃ² appresso sua semenza.

E come fantolin che ânverâ la mamma
tende le braccia, poi che âl latte prese,
per lâanimo che ânfin di fuor sâinfiamma;

ciascun di quei candori in sÃ¹ si stese
con la sua cima, sÃ¬ che lâalto affetto
châelli avieno a Maria mi fu palese.

Indi rimaser lÃ¬ nel mio cospetto,
âRegina celiâ cantando sÃ¬ dolce,
che mai da me non si partÃ¬ âl diletto.

Oh quanta Ã¨ lâubertÃ  che si soffolce
in quelle arche ricchissime che fuoro
a seminar qua giÃ¹ buone bobolce!

Quivi si vive e gode del tesoro
che sâacquistÃ² piangendo ne lo essilio
di BabillÃ²n, ove si lasciÃ² lâoro.

Quivi trÃ¯unfa, sotto lâalto Filio
di Dio e di Maria, di sua vittoria,
e con lâantico e col novo concilio,

colui che tien le chiavi di tal gloria.



Paradiso Â· Canto XXIV


Â«O sodalizio eletto a la gran cena
del benedetto Agnello, il qual vi ciba
sÃ¬, che la vostra voglia Ã¨ sempre piena,

se per grazia di Dio questi preliba
di quel che cade de la vostra mensa,
prima che morte tempo li prescriba,

ponete mente a lâaffezione immensa
e roratelo alquanto: voi bevete
sempre del fonte onde vien quel châei pensaÂ».

CosÃ¬ Beatrice; e quelle anime liete
si fero spere sopra fissi poli,
fiammando, a volte, a guisa di comete.

E come cerchi in tempra dâorÃ¯uoli
si giran sÃ¬, che âl primo a chi pon mente
quÃ¯eto pare, e lâultimo che voli;

cosÃ¬ quelle carole, differente-
mente danzando, de la sua ricchezza
mi facieno stimar, veloci e lente.

Di quella châio notai di piÃ¹ carezza
vidâ Ã¯o uscire un foco sÃ¬ felice,
che nullo vi lasciÃ² di piÃ¹ chiarezza;

e tre fÃ¯ate intorno di Beatrice
si volse con un canto tanto divo,
che la mia fantasia nol mi ridice.

PerÃ² salta la penna e non lo scrivo:
chÃ© lâimagine nostra a cotai pieghe,
non che âl parlare, Ã¨ troppo color vivo.

Â«O santa suora mia che sÃ¬ ne prieghe
divota, per lo tuo ardente affetto
da quella bella spera mi dislegheÂ».

Poscia fermato, il foco benedetto
a la mia donna dirizzÃ² lo spiro,
che favellÃ² cosÃ¬ comâ iâ ho detto.

Ed ella: Â«O luce etterna del gran viro
a cui Nostro Segnor lasciÃ² le chiavi,
châei portÃ² giÃ¹, di questo gaudio miro,

tenta costui di punti lievi e gravi,
come ti piace, intorno de la fede,
per la qual tu su per lo mare andavi.

Sâelli ama bene e bene spera e crede,
non tâÃ¨ occulto, perchÃ© âl viso hai quivi
dovâ ogne cosa dipinta si vede;

ma perchÃ© questo regno ha fatto civi
per la verace fede, a glorÃ¯arla,
di lei parlare Ã¨ ben châa lui arriviÂ».

SÃ¬ come il baccialier sâarma e non parla
fin che âl maestro la question propone,
per approvarla, non per terminarla,

cosÃ¬ mâarmava io dâogne ragione
mentre châella dicea, per esser presto
a tal querente e a tal professione.

Â«DÃ¬, buon Cristiano, fatti manifesto:
fede che Ã¨?Â». Ondâ io levai la fronte
in quella luce onde spirava questo;

poi mi volsi a Beatrice, ed essa pronte
sembianze femmi perchâ Ã¯o spandessi
lâacqua di fuor del mio interno fonte.

Â«La Grazia che mi dÃ  châio mi confessiÂ»,
cominciaâ io, Â«da lâalto primipilo,
faccia li miei concetti bene espressiÂ».

E seguitai: Â«Come âl verace stilo
ne scrisse, padre, del tuo caro frate
che mise teco Roma nel buon filo,

fede Ã¨ sustanza di cose sperate
e argomento de le non parventi;
e questa pare a me sua quiditateÂ».

Allora udiâ: Â«Dirittamente senti,
se bene intendi perchÃ© la ripuose
tra le sustanze, e poi tra li argomentiÂ».

E io appresso: Â«Le profonde cose
che mi largiscon qui la lor parvenza,
a li occhi di lÃ  giÃ¹ son sÃ¬ ascose,

che lâesser loro vâÃ¨ in sola credenza,
sopra la qual si fonda lâalta spene;
e perÃ² di sustanza prende intenza.

E da questa credenza ci convene
silogizzar, sanzâ avere altra vista:
perÃ² intenza dâargomento teneÂ».

Allora udiâ: Â«Se quantunque sâacquista
giÃ¹ per dottrina, fosse cosÃ¬ ânteso,
non lÃ¬ avria loco ingegno di sofistaÂ».

CosÃ¬ spirÃ² di quello amore acceso;
indi soggiunse: Â«Assai bene Ã¨ trascorsa
dâesta moneta giÃ  la lega e âl peso;

ma dimmi se tu lâhai ne la tua borsaÂ».
Ondâ io: Â«SÃ¬ ho, sÃ¬ lucida e sÃ¬ tonda,
che nel suo conio nulla mi sâinforsaÂ».

Appresso uscÃ¬ de la luce profonda
che lÃ¬ splendeva: Â«Questa cara gioia
sopra la quale ogne virtÃ¹ si fonda,

onde ti venne?Â». E io: Â«La larga ploia
de lo Spirito Santo, châÃ¨ diffusa
in su le vecchie e ân su le nuove cuoia,

Ã¨ silogismo che la mâha conchiusa
acutamente sÃ¬, che ânverso dâella
ogne dimostrazion mi pare ottusaÂ».

Io udiâ poi: Â«Lâantica e la novella
proposizion che cosÃ¬ ti conchiude,
perchÃ© lâhai tu per divina favella?Â».

E io: Â«La prova che âl ver mi dischiude,
son lâopere seguite, a che natura
non scalda ferro mai nÃ© batte incudeÂ».

Risposto fummi: Â«DÃ¬, chi tâassicura
che quellâ opere fosser? Quel medesmo
che vuol provarsi, non altri, il ti giuraÂ».

Â«Se âl mondo si rivolse al cristianesmoÂ»,
dissâ io, Â«sanza miracoli, questâ uno
Ã¨ tal, che li altri non sono il centesmo:

chÃ© tu intrasti povero e digiuno
in campo, a seminar la buona pianta
che fu giÃ  vite e ora Ã¨ fatta prunoÂ».

Finito questo, lâalta corte santa
risonÃ² per le spere un âDio laudamoâ
ne la melode che lÃ  sÃ¹ si canta.

E quel baron che sÃ¬ di ramo in ramo,
essaminando, giÃ  tratto mâavea,
che a lâultime fronde appressavamo,

ricominciÃ²: Â«La Grazia, che donnea
con la tua mente, la bocca tâaperse
infino a qui come aprir si dovea,

sÃ¬ châio approvo ciÃ² che fuori emerse;
ma or convien espremer quel che credi,
e onde a la credenza tua sâofferseÂ».

Â«O santo padre, e spirito che vedi
ciÃ² che credesti sÃ¬, che tu vincesti
verâ lo sepulcro piÃ¹ giovani piediÂ»,

cominciaâ io, Â«tu vuoâ châio manifesti
la forma qui del pronto creder mio,
e anche la cagion di lui chiedesti.

E io rispondo: Io credo in uno Dio
solo ed etterno, che tutto âl ciel move,
non moto, con amore e con disio;

e a tal creder non ho io pur prove
fisice e metafisice, ma dalmi
anche la veritÃ  che quinci piove

per MoÃ¯sÃ¨, per profeti e per salmi,
per lâEvangelio e per voi che scriveste
poi che lâardente Spirto vi fÃ© almi;

e credo in tre persone etterne, e queste
credo una essenza sÃ¬ una e sÃ¬ trina,
che soffera congiunto âsonoâ ed âesteâ.

De la profonda condizion divina
châio tocco mo, la mente mi sigilla
piÃ¹ volte lâevangelica dottrina.

Questâ Ã¨ âl principio, questâ Ã¨ la favilla
che si dilata in fiamma poi vivace,
e come stella in cielo in me scintillaÂ».

Come âl segnor châascolta quel che i piace,
da indi abbraccia il servo, gratulando
per la novella, tosto châel si tace;

cosÃ¬, benedicendomi cantando,
tre volte cinse me, sÃ¬ comâ io tacqui,
lâappostolico lume al cui comando

io avea detto: sÃ¬ nel dir li piacqui!



Paradiso Â· Canto XXV


Se mai continga che âl poema sacro
al quale ha posto mano e cielo e terra,
sÃ¬ che mâha fatto per molti anni macro,

vinca la crudeltÃ  che fuor mi serra
del bello ovile ovâ io dormiâ agnello,
nimico ai lupi che li danno guerra;

con altra voce omai, con altro vello
ritornerÃ² poeta, e in sul fonte
del mio battesmo prenderÃ² âl cappello;

perÃ² che ne la fede, che fa conte
lâanime a Dio, quivi intraâ io, e poi
Pietro per lei sÃ¬ mi girÃ² la fronte.

Indi si mosse un lume verso noi
di quella spera ondâ uscÃ¬ la primizia
che lasciÃ² Cristo dâi vicari suoi;

e la mia donna, piena di letizia,
mi disse: Â«Mira, mira: ecco il barone
per cui lÃ  giÃ¹ si vicita GaliziaÂ».

SÃ¬ come quando il colombo si pone
presso al compagno, lâuno a lâaltro pande,
girando e mormorando, lâaffezione;

cosÃ¬ vidâ Ã¯o lâun da lâaltro grande
principe glorÃ¯oso essere accolto,
laudando il cibo che lÃ  sÃ¹ li prande.

Ma poi che âl gratular si fu assolto,
tacito coram me ciascun sâaffisse,
ignito sÃ¬ che vincÃ«a âl mio volto.

Ridendo allora BÃ«atrice disse:
Â«Inclita vita per cui la larghezza
de la nostra basilica si scrisse,

fa risonar la spene in questa altezza:
tu sai, che tante fiate la figuri,
quante IesÃ¹ ai tre fÃ© piÃ¹ carezzaÂ».

Â«Leva la testa e fa che tâassicuri:
che ciÃ² che vien qua sÃ¹ del mortal mondo,
convien châai nostri raggi si maturiÂ».

Questo conforto del foco secondo
mi venne; ondâ io levÃ¤i li occhi aâ monti
che li âncurvaron pria col troppo pondo.

Â«Poi che per grazia vuol che tu tâaffronti
lo nostro Imperadore, anzi la morte,
ne lâaula piÃ¹ secreta coâ suoi conti,

sÃ¬ che, veduto il ver di questa corte,
la spene, che lÃ  giÃ¹ bene innamora,
in te e in altrui di ciÃ² conforte,

diâ quel châellâ Ã¨, diâ come se ne ânfiora
la mente tua, e dÃ¬ onde a te venneÂ».
CosÃ¬ seguÃ¬ âl secondo lume ancora.

E quella pÃ¯a che guidÃ² le penne
de le mie ali a cosÃ¬ alto volo,
a la risposta cosÃ¬ mi prevenne:

Â«La Chiesa militante alcun figliuolo
non ha con piÃ¹ speranza, comâ Ã¨ scritto
nel Sol che raggia tutto nostro stuolo:

perÃ² li Ã¨ conceduto che dâEgitto
vegna in Ierusalemme per vedere,
anzi che âl militar li sia prescritto.

Li altri due punti, che non per sapere
son dimandati, ma perchâ ei rapporti
quanto questa virtÃ¹ tâÃ¨ in piacere,

a lui lascâ io, chÃ© non li saran forti
nÃ© di iattanza; ed elli a ciÃ² risponda,
e la grazia di Dio ciÃ² li comportiÂ».

Come discente châa dottor seconda
pronto e libente in quel châelli Ã¨ esperto,
perchÃ© la sua bontÃ  si disasconda,

Â«SpeneÂ», dissâ io, Â«Ã¨ uno attender certo
de la gloria futura, il qual produce
grazia divina e precedente merto.

Da molte stelle mi vien questa luce;
ma quei la distillÃ² nel mio cor pria
che fu sommo cantor del sommo duce.

âSperino in teâ, ne la sua tÃ«odia
dice, âcolor che sanno il nome tuoâ:
e chi nol sa, sâelli ha la fede mia?

Tu mi stillasti, con lo stillar suo,
ne la pistola poi; sÃ¬ châio son pieno,
e in altrui vostra pioggia repluoÂ».

Mentrâ io diceva, dentro al vivo seno
di quello incendio tremolava un lampo
sÃ¹bito e spesso a guisa di baleno.

Indi spirÃ²: Â«Lâamore ondâ Ã¯o avvampo
ancor verâ la virtÃ¹ che mi seguette
infin la palma e a lâuscir del campo,

vuol châio respiri a te che ti dilette
di lei; ed emmi a grato che tu diche
quello che la speranza ti âmprometteÂ».

E io: Â«Le nove e le scritture antiche
pongon lo segno, ed esso lo mi addita,
de lâanime che Dio sâha fatte amiche.

Dice Isaia che ciascuna vestita
ne la sua terra fia di doppia vesta:
e la sua terra Ã¨ questa dolce vita;

e âl tuo fratello assai vie piÃ¹ digesta,
lÃ  dove tratta de le bianche stole,
questa revelazion ci manifestaÂ».

E prima, appresso al fin dâeste parole,
âSperent in teâ di soprâ a noi sâudÃ¬;
a che rispuoser tutte le carole.

Poscia tra esse un lume si schiarÃ¬
sÃ¬ che, se âl Cancro avesse un tal cristallo,
lâinverno avrebbe un mese dâun sol dÃ¬.

E come surge e va ed entra in ballo
vergine lieta, sol per fare onore
a la novizia, non per alcun fallo,

cosÃ¬ vidâ io lo schiarato splendore
venire aâ due che si volgieno a nota
qual conveniesi al loro ardente amore.

Misesi lÃ¬ nel canto e ne la rota;
e la mia donna in lor tenea lâaspetto,
pur come sposa tacita e immota.

Â«Questi Ã¨ colui che giacque sopra âl petto
del nostro pellicano, e questi fue
di su la croce al grande officio elettoÂ».

La donna mia cosÃ¬; nÃ© perÃ² piÃ¹e
mosser la vista sua di stare attenta
poscia che prima le parole sue.

Qual Ã¨ colui châadocchia e sâargomenta
di vedere eclissar lo sole un poco,
che, per veder, non vedente diventa;

tal mi fecâ Ã¯o a quellâ ultimo foco
mentre che detto fu: Â«PerchÃ© tâabbagli
per veder cosa che qui non ha loco?

In terra Ã¨ terra il mio corpo, e saragli
tanto con li altri, che âl numero nostro
con lâetterno proposito sâagguagli.

Con le due stole nel beato chiostro
son le due luci sole che saliro;
e questo apporterai nel mondo vostroÂ».

A questa voce lâinfiammato giro
si quÃ¯etÃ² con esso il dolce mischio
che si facea nel suon del trino spiro,

sÃ¬ come, per cessar fatica o rischio,
li remi, pria ne lâacqua ripercossi,
tutti si posano al sonar dâun fischio.

Ahi quanto ne la mente mi commossi,
quando mi volsi per veder Beatrice,
per non poter veder, benchÃ© io fossi

presso di lei, e nel mondo felice!



Paradiso Â· Canto XXVI


Mentrâ io dubbiava per lo viso spento,
de la fulgida fiamma che lo spense
uscÃ¬ un spiro che mi fece attento,

dicendo: Â«Intanto che tu ti risense
de la vista che haÃ¯ in me consunta,
ben Ã¨ che ragionando la compense.

Comincia dunque; e dÃ¬ ove sâappunta
lâanima tua, e fa ragion che sia
la vista in te smarrita e non defunta:

perchÃ© la donna che per questa dia
regÃ¯on ti conduce, ha ne lo sguardo
la virtÃ¹ châebbe la man dâAnaniaÂ».

Io dissi: Â«Al suo piacere e tosto e tardo
vegna remedio a li occhi, che fuor porte
quandâ ella entrÃ² col foco ondâ io semprâ ardo.

Lo ben che fa contenta questa corte,
Alfa e O Ã¨ di quanta scrittura
mi legge Amore o lievemente o forteÂ».

Quella medesma voce che paura
tolta mâavea del sÃ¹bito abbarbaglio,
di ragionare ancor mi mise in cura;

e disse: Â«Certo a piÃ¹ angusto vaglio
ti conviene schiarar: dicer convienti
chi drizzÃ² lâarco tuo a tal berzaglioÂ».

E io: Â«Per filosofici argomenti
e per autoritÃ  che quinci scende
cotale amor convien che in me si âmprenti:

chÃ© âl bene, in quanto ben, come sâintende,
cosÃ¬ accende amore, e tanto maggio
quanto piÃ¹ di bontate in sÃ© comprende.

Dunque a lâessenza ovâ Ã¨ tanto avvantaggio,
che ciascun ben che fuor di lei si trova
altro non Ã¨ châun lume di suo raggio,

piÃ¹ che in altra convien che si mova
la mente, amando, di ciascun che cerne
il vero in che si fonda questa prova.

Tal vero a lâintelletto mÃ¯o sterne
colui che mi dimostra il primo amore
di tutte le sustanze sempiterne.

Sternel la voce del verace autore,
che dice a MoÃ¯sÃ¨, di sÃ© parlando:
âIo ti farÃ² vedere ogne valoreâ.

Sternilmi tu ancora, incominciando
lâalto preconio che grida lâarcano
di qui lÃ  giÃ¹ sovra ogne altro bandoÂ».

E io udiâ: Â«Per intelletto umano
e per autoritadi a lui concorde
dâi tuoi amori a Dio guarda il sovrano.

Ma dÃ¬ ancor se tu senti altre corde
tirarti verso lui, sÃ¬ che tu suone
con quanti denti questo amor ti mordeÂ».

Non fu latente la santa intenzione
de lâaguglia di Cristo, anzi mâaccorsi
dove volea menar mia professione.

PerÃ² ricominciai: Â«Tutti quei morsi
che posson far lo cor volgere a Dio,
a la mia caritate son concorsi:

chÃ© lâessere del mondo e lâesser mio,
la morte châel sostenne perchâ io viva,
e quel che spera ogne fedel comâ io,

con la predetta conoscenza viva,
tratto mâhanno del mar de lâamor torto,
e del diritto mâhan posto a la riva.

Le fronde onde sâinfronda tutto lâorto
de lâortolano etterno, amâ io cotanto
quanto da lui a lor di bene Ã¨ portoÂ».

SÃ¬ comâ io tacqui, un dolcissimo canto
risonÃ² per lo cielo, e la mia donna
dicea con li altri: Â«Santo, santo, santo!Â».

E come a lume acuto si disonna
per lo spirto visivo che ricorre
a lo splendor che va di gonna in gonna,

e lo svegliato ciÃ² che vede aborre,
sÃ¬ nescÃ¯a Ã¨ la sÃ¹bita vigilia
fin che la stimativa non soccorre;

cosÃ¬ de li occhi miei ogne quisquilia
fugÃ² Beatrice col raggio dâi suoi,
che rifulgea da piÃ¹ di mille milia:

onde mei che dinanzi vidi poi;
e quasi stupefatto domandai
dâun quarto lume châio vidi tra noi.

E la mia donna: Â«Dentro da quei rai
vagheggia il suo fattor lâanima prima
che la prima virtÃ¹ creasse maiÂ».

Come la fronda che flette la cima
nel transito del vento, e poi si leva
per la propria virtÃ¹ che la soblima,

fecâ io in tanto in quantâ ella diceva,
stupendo, e poi mi rifece sicuro
un disio di parlare ondâ Ã¯o ardeva.

E cominciai: Â«O pomo che maturo
solo prodotto fosti, o padre antico
a cui ciascuna sposa Ã¨ figlia e nuro,

divoto quanto posso a te supplÃ¬co
perchÃ© mi parli: tu vedi mia voglia,
e per udirti tosto non la dicoÂ».

Talvolta un animal coverto broglia,
sÃ¬ che lâaffetto convien che si paia
per lo seguir che face a lui la ânvoglia;

e similmente lâanima primaia
mi facea trasparer per la coverta
quantâ ella a compiacermi venÃ¬a gaia.

Indi spirÃ²: Â«Sanzâ essermi proferta
da te, la voglia tua discerno meglio
che tu qualunque cosa tâÃ¨ piÃ¹ certa;

perchâ io la veggio nel verace speglio
che fa di sÃ© pareglio a lâaltre cose,
e nulla face lui di sÃ© pareglio.

Tu vuogli udir quantâ Ã¨ che Dio mi puose
ne lâeccelso giardino, ove costei
a cosÃ¬ lunga scala ti dispuose,

e quanto fu diletto a li occhi miei,
e la propria cagion del gran disdegno,
e lâidÃ¯oma châusai e che fei.

Or, figluol mio, non il gustar del legno
fu per sÃ© la cagion di tanto essilio,
ma solamente il trapassar del segno.

Quindi onde mosse tua donna Virgilio,
quattromilia trecento e due volumi
di sol desiderai questo concilio;

e vidi lui tornare a tuttâ i lumi
de la sua strada novecento trenta
fÃ¯ate, mentre châÃ¯o in terra fuâmi.

La lingua châio parlai fu tutta spenta
innanzi che a lâovra inconsummabile
fosse la gente di NembrÃ²t attenta:

chÃ© nullo effetto mai razÃ¯onabile,
per lo piacere uman che rinovella
seguendo il cielo, sempre fu durabile.

Opera naturale Ã¨ châuom favella;
ma cosÃ¬ o cosÃ¬, natura lascia
poi fare a voi secondo che vâabbella.

Pria châiâ scendessi a lâinfernale ambascia,
I sâappellava in terra il sommo bene
onde vien la letizia che mi fascia;

e El si chiamÃ² poi: e ciÃ² convene,
chÃ© lâuso dâi mortali Ã¨ come fronda
in ramo, che sen va e altra vene.

Nel monte che si leva piÃ¹ da lâonda,
fuâ io, con vita pura e disonesta,
da la primâ ora a quella che seconda,

come âl sol muta quadra, lâora sestaÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XXVII


âAl Padre, al Figlio, a lo Spirito Santoâ,
cominciÃ², âgloria!â, tutto âl paradiso,
sÃ¬ che mâinebrÃ¯ava il dolce canto.

CiÃ² châio vedeva mi sembiava un riso
de lâuniverso; per che mia ebbrezza
intrava per lâudire e per lo viso.

Oh gioia! oh ineffabile allegrezza!
oh vita intÃ¨gra dâamore e di pace!
oh sanza brama sicura ricchezza!

Dinanzi a li occhi miei le quattro face
stavano accese, e quella che pria venne
incominciÃ² a farsi piÃ¹ vivace,

e tal ne la sembianza sua divenne,
qual diverrebbe Iove, sâelli e Marte
fossero augelli e cambiassersi penne.

La provedenza, che quivi comparte
vice e officio, nel beato coro
silenzio posto avea da ogne parte,

quandâ Ã¯o udiâ: Â«Se io mi trascoloro,
non ti maravigliar, chÃ©, dicendâ io,
vedrai trascolorar tutti costoro.

Quelli châusurpa in terra il luogo mio,
il luogo mio, il luogo mio, che vaca
ne la presenza del Figliuol di Dio,

fattâ ha del cimitero mio cloaca
del sangue e de la puzza; onde âl perverso
che cadde di qua sÃ¹, lÃ  giÃ¹ si placaÂ».

Di quel color che per lo sole avverso
nube dipigne da sera e da mane,
vidâ Ã¯o allora tutto âl ciel cosperso.

E come donna onesta che permane
di sÃ© sicura, e per lâaltrui fallanza,
pur ascoltando, timida si fane,

cosÃ¬ Beatrice trasmutÃ² sembianza;
e tale eclissi credo che ân ciel fue
quando patÃ¬ la supprema possanza.

Poi procedetter le parole sue
con voce tanto da sÃ© trasmutata,
che la sembianza non si mutÃ² piÃ¹e:

Â«Non fu la sposa di Cristo allevata
del sangue mio, di Lin, di quel di Cleto,
per essere ad acquisto dâoro usata;

ma per acquisto dâesto viver lieto
e Sisto e PÃ¯o e Calisto e Urbano
sparser lo sangue dopo molto fleto.

Non fu nostra intenzion châa destra mano
dâi nostri successor parte sedesse,
parte da lâaltra del popol cristiano;

nÃ© che le chiavi che mi fuor concesse,
divenisser signaculo in vessillo
che contra battezzati combattesse;

nÃ© châio fossi figura di sigillo
a privilegi venduti e mendaci,
ondâ io sovente arrosso e disfavillo.

In vesta di pastor lupi rapaci
si veggion di qua sÃ¹ per tutti i paschi:
o difesa di Dio, perchÃ© pur giaci?

Del sangue nostro Caorsini e Guaschi
sâapparecchian di bere: o buon principio,
a che vil fine convien che tu caschi!

Ma lâalta provedenza, che con Scipio
difese a Roma la gloria del mondo,
soccorrÃ  tosto, sÃ¬ comâ io concipio;

e tu, figliuol, che per lo mortal pondo
ancor giÃ¹ tornerai, apri la bocca,
e non asconder quel châio non ascondoÂ».

SÃ¬ come di vapor gelati fiocca
in giuso lâaere nostro, quando âl corno
de la capra del ciel col sol si tocca,

in sÃ¹ vidâ io cosÃ¬ lâetera addorno
farsi e fioccar di vapor trÃ¯unfanti
che fatto avien con noi quivi soggiorno.

Lo viso mio seguiva i suoi sembianti,
e seguÃ¬ fin che âl mezzo, per lo molto,
li tolse il trapassar del piÃ¹ avanti.

Onde la donna, che mi vide assolto
de lâattendere in sÃ¹, mi disse: Â«Adima
il viso e guarda come tu seâ vÃ²ltoÂ».

Da lâora châÃ¯o avea guardato prima
iâ vidi mosso me per tutto lâarco
che fa dal mezzo al fine il primo clima;

sÃ¬ châio vedea di lÃ  da Gade il varco
folle dâUlisse, e di qua presso il lito
nel qual si fece Europa dolce carco.

E piÃ¹ mi fora discoverto il sito
di questa aiuola; ma âl sol procedea
sotto i mieâ piedi un segno e piÃ¹ partito.

La mente innamorata, che donnea
con la mia donna sempre, di ridure
ad essa li occhi piÃ¹ che mai ardea;

e se natura o arte fÃ© pasture
da pigliare occhi, per aver la mente,
in carne umana o ne le sue pitture,

tutte adunate, parrebber nÃ¯ente
verâ lo piacer divin che mi refulse,
quando mi volsi al suo viso ridente.

E la virtÃ¹ che lo sguardo mâindulse,
del bel nido di Leda mi divelse,
e nel ciel velocissimo mâimpulse.

Le parti sue vivissime ed eccelse
sÃ¬ uniforme son, châiâ non so dire
qual BÃ«atrice per loco mi scelse.

Ma ella, che vedÃ«a âl mio disire,
incominciÃ², ridendo tanto lieta,
che Dio parea nel suo volto gioire:

Â«La natura del mondo, che quÃ¯eta
il mezzo e tutto lâaltro intorno move,
quinci comincia come da sua meta;

e questo cielo non ha altro dove
che la mente divina, in che sâaccende
lâamor che âl volge e la virtÃ¹ châei piove.

Luce e amor dâun cerchio lui comprende,
sÃ¬ come questo li altri; e quel precinto
colui che âl cinge solamente intende.

Non Ã¨ suo moto per altro distinto,
ma li altri son mensurati da questo,
sÃ¬ come diece da mezzo e da quinto;

e come il tempo tegna in cotal testo
le sue radici e ne li altri le fronde,
omai a te puÃ² esser manifesto.

Oh cupidigia che i mortali affonde
sÃ¬ sotto te, che nessuno ha podere
di trarre li occhi fuor de le tue onde!

Ben fiorisce ne li uomini il volere;
ma la pioggia continÃ¼a converte
in bozzacchioni le sosine vere.

Fede e innocenza son reperte
solo neâ parvoletti; poi ciascuna
pria fugge che le guance sian coperte.

Tale, balbuzÃ¯endo ancor, digiuna,
che poi divora, con la lingua sciolta,
qualunque cibo per qualunque luna;

e tal, balbuzÃ¯endo, ama e ascolta
la madre sua, che, con loquela intera,
disÃ¯a poi di vederla sepolta.

CosÃ¬ si fa la pelle bianca nera
nel primo aspetto de la bella figlia
di quel châapporta mane e lascia sera.

Tu, perchÃ© non ti facci maraviglia,
pensa che ân terra non Ã¨ chi governi;
onde sÃ¬ svÃ¯a lâumana famiglia.

Ma prima che gennaio tutto si sverni
per la centesma châÃ¨ lÃ  giÃ¹ negletta,
raggeran sÃ¬ questi cerchi superni,

che la fortuna che tanto sâaspetta,
le poppe volgerÃ  uâ son le prore,
sÃ¬ che la classe correrÃ  diretta;

e vero frutto verrÃ  dopo âl fioreÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XXVIII


Poscia che âncontro a la vita presente
dâi miseri mortali aperse âl vero
quella che âmparadisa la mia mente,

come in lo specchio fiamma di doppiero
vede colui che se nâalluma retro,
prima che lâabbia in vista o in pensiero,

e sÃ© rivolge per veder se âl vetro
li dice il vero, e vede châel sâaccorda
con esso come nota con suo metro;

cosÃ¬ la mia memoria si ricorda
châio feci riguardando neâ belli occhi
onde a pigliarmi fece Amor la corda.

E comâ io mi rivolsi e furon tocchi
li miei da ciÃ² che pare in quel volume,
quandunque nel suo giro ben sâadocchi,

un punto vidi che raggiava lume
acuto sÃ¬, che âl viso châelli affoca
chiuder conviensi per lo forte acume;

e quale stella par quinci piÃ¹ poca,
parrebbe luna, locata con esso
come stella con stella si collÃ²ca.

Forse cotanto quanto pare appresso
alo cigner la luce che âl dipigne
quando âl vapor che âl porta piÃ¹ Ã¨ spesso,

distante intorno al punto un cerchio dâigne
si girava sÃ¬ ratto, châavria vinto
quel moto che piÃ¹ tosto il mondo cigne;

e questo era dâun altro circumcinto,
e quel dal terzo, e âl terzo poi dal quarto,
dal quinto il quarto, e poi dal sesto il quinto.

Sopra seguiva il settimo sÃ¬ sparto
giÃ  di larghezza, che âl messo di Iuno
intero a contenerlo sarebbe arto.

CosÃ¬ lâottavo e âl nono; e chiascheduno
piÃ¹ tardo si movea, secondo châera
in numero distante piÃ¹ da lâuno;

e quello avea la fiamma piÃ¹ sincera
cui men distava la favilla pura,
credo, perÃ² che piÃ¹ di lei sâinvera.

La donna mia, che mi vedÃ«a in cura
forte sospeso, disse: Â«Da quel punto
depende il cielo e tutta la natura.

Mira quel cerchio che piÃ¹ li Ã¨ congiunto;
e sappi che âl suo muovere Ã¨ sÃ¬ tosto
per lâaffocato amore ondâ elli Ã¨ puntoÂ».

E io a lei: Â«Se âl mondo fosse posto
con lâordine châio veggio in quelle rote,
sazio mâavrebbe ciÃ² che mâÃ¨ proposto;

ma nel mondo sensibile si puote
veder le volte tanto piÃ¹ divine,
quantâ elle son dal centro piÃ¹ remote.

Onde, se âl mio disir dee aver fine
in questo miro e angelico templo
che solo amore e luce ha per confine,

udir convienmi ancor come lâessemplo
e lâessemplare non vanno dâun modo,
chÃ© io per me indarno a ciÃ² contemploÂ».

Â«Se li tuoi diti non sono a tal nodo
sufficÃ¯enti, non Ã¨ maraviglia:
tanto, per non tentare, Ã¨ fatto sodo!Â».

CosÃ¬ la donna mia; poi disse: Â«Piglia
quel châio ti dicerÃ², se vuoâ saziarti;
e intorno da esso tâassottiglia.

Li cerchi corporai sono ampi e arti
secondo il piÃ¹ e âl men de la virtute
che si distende per tutte lor parti.

Maggior bontÃ  vuol far maggior salute;
maggior salute maggior corpo cape,
sâelli ha le parti igualmente compiute.

Dunque costui che tutto quanto rape
lâaltro universo seco, corrisponde
al cerchio che piÃ¹ ama e che piÃ¹ sape:

per che, se tu a la virtÃ¹ circonde
la tua misura, non a la parvenza
de le sustanze che tâappaion tonde,

tu vederai mirabil consequenza
di maggio a piÃ¹ e di minore a meno,
in ciascun cielo, a sÃ¼a intelligenzaÂ».

Come rimane splendido e sereno
lâemisperio de lâaere, quando soffia
Borea da quella guancia ondâ Ã¨ piÃ¹ leno,

per che si purga e risolve la roffia
che pria turbava, sÃ¬ che âl ciel ne ride
con le bellezze dâogne sua paroffia;

cosÃ¬ fecâÃ¯o, poi che mi provide
la donna mia del suo risponder chiaro,
e come stella in cielo il ver si vide.

E poi che le parole sue restaro,
non altrimenti ferro disfavilla
che bolle, come i cerchi sfavillaro.

Lâincendio suo seguiva ogne scintilla;
ed eran tante, che âl numero loro
piÃ¹ che âl doppiar de li scacchi sâinmilla.

Io sentiva osannar di coro in coro
al punto fisso che li tiene a li ubi,
e terrÃ  sempre, neâ quai sempre fuoro.

E quella che vedÃ«a i pensier dubi
ne la mia mente, disse: Â«I cerchi primi
tâhanno mostrato Serafi e Cherubi.

CosÃ¬ veloci seguono i suoi vimi,
per somigliarsi al punto quanto ponno;
e posson quanto a veder son soblimi.

Quelli altri amori che ântorno li vonno,
si chiaman Troni del divino aspetto,
per che âl primo ternaro terminonno;

e dei saper che tutti hanno diletto
quanto la sua veduta si profonda
nel vero in che si queta ogne intelletto.

Quinci si puÃ² veder come si fonda
lâesser beato ne lâatto che vede,
non in quel châama, che poscia seconda;

e del vedere Ã¨ misura mercede,
che grazia partorisce e buona voglia:
cosÃ¬ di grado in grado si procede.

Lâaltro ternaro, che cosÃ¬ germoglia
in questa primavera sempiterna
che notturno ArÃ¯ete non dispoglia,

perpetÃ¼alemente âOsannaâ sberna
con tre melode, che suonano in tree
ordini di letizia onde sâinterna.

In essa gerarcia son lâaltre dee:
prima Dominazioni, e poi Virtudi;
lâordine terzo di Podestadi Ã¨e.

Poscia neâ due penultimi tripudi
Principati e Arcangeli si girano;
lâultimo Ã¨ tutto dâAngelici ludi.

Questi ordini di sÃ¹ tutti sâammirano,
e di giÃ¹ vincon sÃ¬, che verso Dio
tutti tirati sono e tutti tirano.

E DÃ¯onisio con tanto disio
a contemplar questi ordini si mise,
che li nomÃ² e distinse comâ io.

Ma Gregorio da lui poi si divise;
onde, sÃ¬ tosto come li occhi aperse
in questo ciel, di sÃ© medesmo rise.

E se tanto secreto ver proferse
mortale in terra, non voglio châammiri:
chÃ© chi âl vide qua sÃ¹ gliel discoperse

con altro assai del ver di questi giriÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XXIX


Quando ambedue li figli di Latona,
coperti del Montone e de la Libra,
fanno de lâorizzonte insieme zona,

quantâ Ã¨ dal punto che âl cenÃ¬t inlibra
infin che lâuno e lâaltro da quel cinto,
cambiando lâemisperio, si dilibra,

tanto, col volto di riso dipinto,
si tacque BÃ«atrice, riguardando
fiso nel punto che mâavÃ«a vinto.

Poi cominciÃ²: Â«Io dico, e non dimando,
quel che tu vuoli udir, perchâ io lâho visto
lÃ  âve sâappunta ogne ubi e ogne quando.

Non per aver a sÃ© di bene acquisto,
châesser non puÃ², ma perchÃ© suo splendore
potesse, risplendendo, dir âSubsistoâ,

in sua etternitÃ  di tempo fore,
fuor dâogne altro comprender, come i piacque,
sâaperse in nuovi amor lâetterno amore.

NÃ© prima quasi torpente si giacque;
chÃ© nÃ© prima nÃ© poscia procedette
lo discorrer di Dio sovra questâ acque.

Forma e materia, congiunte e purette,
usciro ad esser che non avia fallo,
come dâarco tricordo tre saette.

E come in vetro, in ambra o in cristallo
raggio resplende sÃ¬, che dal venire
a lâesser tutto non Ã¨ intervallo,

cosÃ¬ âl triforme effetto del suo sire
ne lâesser suo raggiÃ² insieme tutto
sanza distinzÃ¯one in essordire.

Concreato fu ordine e costrutto
a le sustanze; e quelle furon cima
nel mondo in che puro atto fu produtto;

pura potenza tenne la parte ima;
nel mezzo strinse potenza con atto
tal vime, che giÃ  mai non si divima.

Ieronimo vi scrisse lungo tratto
di secoli de li angeli creati
anzi che lâaltro mondo fosse fatto;

ma questo vero Ã¨ scritto in molti lati
da li scrittor de lo Spirito Santo,
e tu te nâavvedrai se bene agguati;

e anche la ragione il vede alquanto,
che non concederebbe che â motori
sanza sua perfezion fosser cotanto.

Or sai tu dove e quando questi amori
furon creati e come: sÃ¬ che spenti
nel tuo disÃ¯o giÃ  son tre ardori.

NÃ© giugneriesi, numerando, al venti
sÃ¬ tosto, come de li angeli parte
turbÃ² il suggetto dâi vostri alimenti.

Lâaltra rimase, e cominciÃ² questâ arte
che tu discerni, con tanto diletto,
che mai da circÃ¼ir non si diparte.

Principio del cader fu il maladetto
superbir di colui che tu vedesti
da tutti i pesi del mondo costretto.

Quelli che vedi qui furon modesti
a riconoscer sÃ© da la bontate
che li avea fatti a tanto intender presti:

per che le viste lor furo essaltate
con grazia illuminante e con lor merto,
si câhanno ferma e piena volontate;

e non voglio che dubbi, ma sia certo,
che ricever la grazia Ã¨ meritorio
secondo che lâaffetto lâÃ¨ aperto.

Omai dintorno a questo consistorio
puoi contemplare assai, se le parole
mie son ricolte, sanzâ altro aiutorio.

Ma perchÃ© ân terra per le vostre scole
si legge che lâangelica natura
Ã¨ tal, che ântende e si ricorda e vole,

ancor dirÃ², perchÃ© tu veggi pura
la veritÃ  che lÃ  giÃ¹ si confonde,
equivocando in sÃ¬ fatta lettura.

Queste sustanze, poi che fur gioconde
de la faccia di Dio, non volser viso
da essa, da cui nulla si nasconde:

perÃ² non hanno vedere interciso
da novo obietto, e perÃ² non bisogna
rememorar per concetto diviso;

sÃ¬ che lÃ  giÃ¹, non dormendo, si sogna,
credendo e non credendo dicer vero;
ma ne lâuno Ã¨ piÃ¹ colpa e piÃ¹ vergogna.

Voi non andate giÃ¹ per un sentiero
filosofando: tanto vi trasporta
lâamor de lâapparenza e âl suo pensiero!

E ancor questo qua sÃ¹ si comporta
con men disdegno che quando Ã¨ posposta
la divina Scrittura o quando Ã¨ torta.

Non vi si pensa quanto sangue costa
seminarla nel mondo e quanto piace
chi umilmente con essa sâaccosta.

Per apparer ciascun sâingegna e face
sue invenzioni; e quelle son trascorse
daâ predicanti e âl Vangelio si tace.

Un dice che la luna si ritorse
ne la passion di Cristo e sâinterpuose,
per che âl lume del sol giÃ¹ non si porse;

e mente, chÃ© la luce si nascose
da sÃ©: perÃ² a li Spani e a lâIndi
come aâ Giudei tale eclissi rispuose.

Non ha Fiorenza tanti Lapi e Bindi
quante sÃ¬ fatte favole per anno
in pergamo si gridan quinci e quindi:

sÃ¬ che le pecorelle, che non sanno,
tornan del pasco pasciute di vento,
e non le scusa non veder lo danno.

Non disse Cristo al suo primo convento:
âAndate, e predicate al mondo cianceâ;
ma diede lor verace fondamento;

e quel tanto sonÃ² ne le sue guance,
sÃ¬ châa pugnar per accender la fede
de lâEvangelio fero scudo e lance.

Ora si va con motti e con iscede
a predicare, e pur che ben si rida,
gonfia il cappuccio e piÃ¹ non si richiede.

Ma tale uccel nel becchetto sâannida,
che se âl vulgo il vedesse, vederebbe
la perdonanza di châel si confida:

per cui tanta stoltezza in terra crebbe,
che, sanza prova dâalcun testimonio,
ad ogne promession si correrebbe.

Di questo ingrassa il porco santâ Antonio,
e altri assai che sono ancor piÃ¹ porci,
pagando di moneta sanza conio.

Ma perchÃ© siam digressi assai, ritorci
li occhi oramai verso la dritta strada,
sÃ¬ che la via col tempo si raccorci.

Questa natura sÃ¬ oltre sâingrada
in numero, che mai non fu loquela
nÃ© concetto mortal che tanto vada;

e se tu guardi quel che si revela
per DanÃ¯el, vedrai che ân sue migliaia
determinato numero si cela.

La prima luce, che tutta la raia,
per tanti modi in essa si recepe,
quanti son li splendori a chi sâappaia.

Onde, perÃ² che a lâatto che concepe
segue lâaffetto, dâamar la dolcezza
diversamente in essa ferve e tepe.

Vedi lâeccelso omai e la larghezza
de lâetterno valor, poscia che tanti
speculi fatti sâha in che si spezza,

uno manendo in sÃ© come davantiÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XXX


Forse semilia miglia di lontano
ci ferve lâora sesta, e questo mondo
china giÃ  lâombra quasi al letto piano,

quando âl mezzo del cielo, a noi profondo,
comincia a farsi tal, châalcuna stella
perde il parere infino a questo fondo;

e come vien la chiarissima ancella
del sol piÃ¹ oltre, cosÃ¬ âl ciel si chiude
di vista in vista infino a la piÃ¹ bella.

Non altrimenti il trÃ¯unfo che lude
sempre dintorno al punto che mi vinse,
parendo inchiuso da quel châelli ânchiude,

a poco a poco al mio veder si stinse:
per che tornar con li occhi a BÃ«atrice
nulla vedere e amor mi costrinse.

Se quanto infino a qui di lei si dice
fosse conchiuso tutto in una loda,
poca sarebbe a fornir questa vice.

La bellezza châio vidi si trasmoda
non pur di lÃ  da noi, ma certo io credo
che solo il suo fattor tutta la goda.

Da questo passo vinto mi concedo
piÃ¹ che giÃ  mai da punto di suo tema
soprato fosse comico o tragedo:

chÃ©, come sole in viso che piÃ¹ trema,
cosÃ¬ lo rimembrar del dolce riso
la mente mia da me medesmo scema.

Dal primo giorno châiâ vidi il suo viso
in questa vita, infino a questa vista,
non mâÃ¨ il seguire al mio cantar preciso;

ma or convien che mio seguir desista
piÃ¹ dietro a sua bellezza, poetando,
come a lâultimo suo ciascuno artista.

Cotal qual io lascio a maggior bando
che quel de la mia tuba, che deduce
lâardÃ¼a sua matera terminando,

con atto e voce di spedito duce
ricominciÃ²: Â«Noi siamo usciti fore
del maggior corpo al ciel châÃ¨ pura luce:

luce intellettÃ¼al, piena dâamore;
amor di vero ben, pien di letizia;
letizia che trascende ogne dolzore.

Qui vederai lâuna e lâaltra milizia
di paradiso, e lâuna in quelli aspetti
che tu vedrai a lâultima giustiziaÂ».

Come sÃ¹bito lampo che discetti
li spiriti visivi, sÃ¬ che priva
da lâatto lâocchio di piÃ¹ forti obietti,

cosÃ¬ mi circunfulse luce viva,
e lasciommi fasciato di tal velo
del suo fulgor, che nulla mâappariva.

Â«Sempre lâamor che queta questo cielo
accoglie in sÃ© con sÃ¬ fatta salute,
per far disposto a sua fiamma il candeloÂ».

Non fur piÃ¹ tosto dentro a me venute
queste parole brievi, châio compresi
me sormontar di soprâ a mia virtute;

e di novella vista mi raccesi
tale, che nulla luce Ã¨ tanto mera,
che li occhi miei non si fosser difesi;

e vidi lume in forma di rivera
fulvido di fulgore, intra due rive
dipinte di mirabil primavera.

Di tal fiumana uscian faville vive,
e dâogne parte si mettien neâ fiori,
quasi rubin che oro circunscrive;

poi, come inebrÃ¯ate da li odori,
riprofondavan sÃ© nel miro gurge,
e sâuna intrava, unâaltra nâuscia fori.

Â«Lâalto disio che mo tâinfiamma e urge,
dâaver notizia di ciÃ² che tu vei,
tanto mi piace piÃ¹ quanto piÃ¹ turge;

ma di questâ acqua convien che tu bei
prima che tanta sete in te si saziÂ»:
cosÃ¬ mi disse il sol de li occhi miei.

Anche soggiunse: Â«Il fiume e li topazi
châentrano ed escono e âl rider de lâerbe
son di lor vero umbriferi prefazi.

Non che da sÃ© sian queste cose acerbe;
ma Ã¨ difetto da la parte tua,
che non hai viste ancor tanto superbeÂ».

Non Ã¨ fantin che sÃ¬ sÃ¹bito rua
col volto verso il latte, se si svegli
molto tardato da lâusanza sua,

come fecâ io, per far migliori spegli
ancor de li occhi, chinandomi a lâonda
che si deriva perchÃ© vi sâimmegli;

e sÃ¬ come di lei bevve la gronda
de le palpebre mie, cosÃ¬ mi parve
di sua lunghezza divenuta tonda.

Poi, come gente stata sotto larve,
che pare altro che prima, se si sveste
la sembianza non sÃ¼a in che disparve,

cosÃ¬ mi si cambiaro in maggior feste
li fiori e le faville, sÃ¬ châio vidi
ambo le corti del ciel manifeste.

O isplendor di Dio, per cuâ io vidi
lâalto trÃ¯unfo del regno verace,
dammi virtÃ¹ a dir comâ Ã¯o il vidi!

Lume Ã¨ lÃ  sÃ¹ che visibile face
lo creatore a quella creatura
che solo in lui vedere ha la sua pace.

Eâ si distende in circular figura,
in tanto che la sua circunferenza
sarebbe al sol troppo larga cintura.

Fassi di raggio tutta sua parvenza
reflesso al sommo del mobile primo,
che prende quindi vivere e potenza.

E come clivo in acqua di suo imo
si specchia, quasi per vedersi addorno,
quando Ã¨ nel verde e neâ fioretti opimo,

sÃ¬, soprastando al lume intorno intorno,
vidi specchiarsi in piÃ¹ di mille soglie
quanto di noi lÃ  sÃ¹ fatto ha ritorno.

E se lâinfimo grado in sÃ© raccoglie
sÃ¬ grande lume, quanta Ã¨ la larghezza
di questa rosa ne lâestreme foglie!

La vista mia ne lâampio e ne lâaltezza
non si smarriva, ma tutto prendeva
il quanto e âl quale di quella allegrezza.

Presso e lontano, lÃ¬, nÃ© pon nÃ© leva:
chÃ© dove Dio sanza mezzo governa,
la legge natural nulla rileva.

Nel giallo de la rosa sempiterna,
che si digrada e dilata e redole
odor di lode al sol che sempre verna,

qual Ã¨ colui che tace e dicer vole,
mi trasse BÃ«atrice, e disse: Â«Mira
quanto Ã¨ âl convento de le bianche stole!

Vedi nostra cittÃ  quantâ ella gira;
vedi li nostri scanni sÃ¬ ripieni,
che poca gente piÃ¹ ci si disira.

E ân quel gran seggio a che tu li occhi tieni
per la corona che giÃ  vâÃ¨ sÃ¹ posta,
prima che tu a queste nozze ceni,

sederÃ  lâalma, che fia giÃ¹ agosta,
de lâalto Arrigo, châa drizzare Italia
verrÃ  in prima châella sia disposta.

La cieca cupidigia che vâammalia
simili fatti vâha al fantolino
che muor per fame e caccia via la balia.

E fia prefetto nel foro divino
allora tal, che palese e coverto
non anderÃ  con lui per un cammino.

Ma poco poi sarÃ  da Dio sofferto
nel santo officio; châel sarÃ  detruso
lÃ  dove Simon mago Ã¨ per suo merto,

e farÃ  quel dâAlagna intrar piÃ¹ giusoÂ».



Paradiso Â· Canto XXXI


In forma dunque di candida rosa
mi si mostrava la milizia santa
che nel suo sangue Cristo fece sposa;

ma lâaltra, che volando vede e canta
la gloria di colui che la ânnamora
e la bontÃ  che la fece cotanta,

sÃ¬ come schiera dâape che sâinfiora
una fÃ¯ata e una si ritorna
lÃ  dove suo laboro sâinsapora,

nel gran fior discendeva che sâaddorna
di tante foglie, e quindi risaliva
lÃ  dove âl sÃ¼o amor sempre soggiorna.

Le facce tutte avean di fiamma viva
e lâali dâoro, e lâaltro tanto bianco,
che nulla neve a quel termine arriva.

Quando scendean nel fior, di banco in banco
porgevan de la pace e de lâardore
châelli acquistavan ventilando il fianco.

NÃ© lâinterporsi tra âl disopra e âl fiore
di tanta moltitudine volante
impediva la vista e lo splendore:

chÃ© la luce divina Ã¨ penetrante
per lâuniverso secondo châÃ¨ degno,
sÃ¬ che nulla le puote essere ostante.

Questo sicuro e gaudÃ¯oso regno,
frequente in gente antica e in novella,
viso e amore avea tutto ad un segno.

O trina luce che ân unica stella
scintillando a lor vista, sÃ¬ li appaga!
guarda qua giuso a la nostra procella!

Se i barbari, venendo da tal plaga
che ciascun giorno dâElice si cuopra,
rotante col suo figlio ondâ ella Ã¨ vaga,

veggendo Roma e lâardÃ¼a sua opra,
stupefaciensi, quando Laterano
a le cose mortali andÃ² di sopra;

Ã¯o, che al divino da lâumano,
a lâetterno dal tempo era venuto,
e di Fiorenza in popol giusto e sano,

di che stupor dovea esser compiuto!
Certo tra esso e âl gaudio mi facea
libito non udire e starmi muto.

E quasi peregrin che si ricrea
nel tempio del suo voto riguardando,
e spera giÃ  ridir comâ ello stea,

su per la viva luce passeggiando,
menava Ã¯o li occhi per li gradi,
mo sÃ¹, mo giÃ¹ e mo recirculando.

VedÃ«a visi a caritÃ  sÃ¼adi,
dâaltrui lume fregiati e di suo riso,
e atti ornati di tutte onestadi.

La forma general di paradiso
giÃ  tutta mÃ¯o sguardo avea compresa,
in nulla parte ancor fermato fiso;

e volgeami con voglia rÃ¯accesa
per domandar la mia donna di cose
di che la mente mia era sospesa.

Uno intendÃ«a, e altro mi rispuose:
credea veder Beatrice e vidi un sene
vestito con le genti glorÃ¯ose.

Diffuso era per li occhi e per le gene
di benigna letizia, in atto pio
quale a tenero padre si convene.

E Â«Ovâ Ã¨ ella?Â», sÃ¹bito dissâ io.
Ondâ elli: Â«A terminar lo tuo disiro
mosse Beatrice me del loco mio;

e se riguardi sÃ¹ nel terzo giro
dal sommo grado, tu la rivedrai
nel trono che suoi merti le sortiroÂ».

Sanza risponder, li occhi sÃ¹ levai,
e vidi lei che si facea corona
reflettendo da sÃ© li etterni rai.

Da quella regÃ¯on che piÃ¹ sÃ¹ tona
occhio mortale alcun tanto non dista,
qualunque in mare piÃ¹ giÃ¹ sâabbandona,

quanto lÃ¬ da Beatrice la mia vista;
ma nulla mi facea, chÃ© sÃ¼a effige
non discendÃ«a a me per mezzo mista.

Â«O donna in cui la mia speranza vige,
e che soffristi per la mia salute
in inferno lasciar le tue vestige,

di tante cose quantâ iâ ho vedute,
dal tuo podere e da la tua bontate
riconosco la grazia e la virtute.

Tu mâhai di servo tratto a libertate
per tutte quelle vie, per tuttâ i modi
che di ciÃ² fare avei la potestate.

La tua magnificenza in me custodi,
sÃ¬ che lâanima mia, che fattâ hai sana,
piacente a te dal corpo si disnodiÂ».

CosÃ¬ orai; e quella, sÃ¬ lontana
come parea, sorrise e riguardommi;
poi si tornÃ² a lâetterna fontana.

E âl santo sene: Â«AcciÃ² che tu assommi
perfettamenteÂ», disse, Â«il tuo cammino,
a che priego e amor santo mandommi,

vola con li occhi per questo giardino;
chÃ© veder lui tâacconcerÃ  lo sguardo
piÃ¹ al montar per lo raggio divino.

E la regina del cielo, ondâ Ã¯o ardo
tutto dâamor, ne farÃ  ogne grazia,
perÃ² châiâ sono il suo fedel BernardoÂ».

Qual Ã¨ colui che forse di Croazia
viene a veder la Veronica nostra,
che per lâantica fame non sen sazia,

ma dice nel pensier, fin che si mostra:
âSegnor mio IesÃ¹ Cristo, Dio verace,
or fu sÃ¬ fatta la sembianza vostra?â;

tal era io mirando la vivace
caritÃ  di colui che ân questo mondo,
contemplando, gustÃ² di quella pace.

Â«Figliuol di grazia, questâ esser giocondoÂ»,
cominciÃ² elli, Â«non ti sarÃ  noto,
tenendo li occhi pur qua giÃ¹ al fondo;

ma guarda i cerchi infino al piÃ¹ remoto,
tanto che veggi seder la regina
cui questo regno Ã¨ suddito e devotoÂ».

Io levai li occhi; e come da mattina
la parte orÃ¯ental de lâorizzonte
soverchia quella dove âl sol declina,

cosÃ¬, quasi di valle andando a monte
con li occhi, vidi parte ne lo stremo
vincer di lume tutta lâaltra fronte.

E come quivi ove sâaspetta il temo
che mal guidÃ² Fetonte, piÃ¹ sâinfiamma,
e quinci e quindi il lume si fa scemo,

cosÃ¬ quella pacifica oriafiamma
nel mezzo sâavvivava, e dâogne parte
per igual modo allentava la fiamma;

e a quel mezzo, con le penne sparte,
vidâ io piÃ¹ di mille angeli festanti,
ciascun distinto di fulgore e dâarte.

Vidi a lor giochi quivi e a lor canti
ridere una bellezza, che letizia
era ne li occhi a tutti li altri santi;

e sâio avessi in dir tanta divizia
quanta ad imaginar, non ardirei
lo minimo tentar di sua delizia.

Bernardo, come vide li occhi miei
nel caldo suo caler fissi e attenti,
li suoi con tanto affetto volse a lei,

che â miei di rimirar fÃ© piÃ¹ ardenti.



Paradiso Â· Canto XXXII


Affetto al suo piacer, quel contemplante
libero officio di dottore assunse,
e cominciÃ² queste parole sante:

Â«La piaga che Maria richiuse e unse,
quella châÃ¨ tanto bella daâ suoi piedi
Ã¨ colei che lâaperse e che la punse.

Ne lâordine che fanno i terzi sedi,
siede Rachel di sotto da costei
con BÃ«atrice, sÃ¬ come tu vedi.

Sarra e Rebecca, IudÃ¬t e colei
che fu bisava al cantor che per doglia
del fallo disse âMiserere meiâ,

puoi tu veder cosÃ¬ di soglia in soglia
giÃ¹ digradar, comâ io châa proprio nome
vo per la rosa giÃ¹ di foglia in foglia.

E dal settimo grado in giÃ¹, sÃ¬ come
infino ad esso, succedono Ebree,
dirimendo del fior tutte le chiome;

perchÃ©, secondo lo sguardo che fÃ©e
la fede in Cristo, queste sono il muro
a che si parton le sacre scalee.

Da questa parte onde âl fiore Ã¨ maturo
di tutte le sue foglie, sono assisi
quei che credettero in Cristo venturo;

da lâaltra parte onde sono intercisi
di vÃ²ti i semicirculi, si stanno
quei châa Cristo venuto ebber li visi.

E come quinci il glorÃ¯oso scanno
de la donna del cielo e li altri scanni
di sotto lui cotanta cerna fanno,

cosÃ¬ di contra quel del gran Giovanni,
che sempre santo âl diserto e âl martiro
sofferse, e poi lâinferno da due anni;

e sotto lui cosÃ¬ cerner sortiro
Francesco, Benedetto e Augustino
e altri fin qua giÃ¹ di giro in giro.

Or mira lâalto proveder divino:
chÃ© lâuno e lâaltro aspetto de la fede
igualmente empierÃ  questo giardino.

E sappi che dal grado in giÃ¹ che fiede
a mezzo il tratto le due discrezioni,
per nullo proprio merito si siede,

ma per lâaltrui, con certe condizioni:
chÃ© tutti questi son spiriti ascolti
prima châavesser vere elezÃ¯oni.

Ben te ne puoi accorger per li volti
e anche per le voci pÃ¼erili,
se tu li guardi bene e se li ascolti.

Or dubbi tu e dubitando sili;
ma io discioglierÃ² âl forte legame
in che ti stringon li pensier sottili.

Dentro a lâampiezza di questo reame
casÃ¼al punto non puote aver sito,
se non come tristizia o sete o fame:

chÃ© per etterna legge Ã¨ stabilito
quantunque vedi, sÃ¬ che giustamente
ci si risponde da lâanello al dito;

e perÃ² questa festinata gente
a vera vita non Ã¨ sine causa
intra sÃ© qui piÃ¹ e meno eccellente.

Lo rege per cui questo regno pausa
in tanto amore e in tanto diletto,
che nulla volontÃ  Ã¨ di piÃ¹ ausa,

le menti tutte nel suo lieto aspetto
creando, a suo piacer di grazia dota
diversamente; e qui basti lâeffetto.

E ciÃ² espresso e chiaro vi si nota
ne la Scrittura santa in quei gemelli
che ne la madre ebber lâira commota.

PerÃ², secondo il color dâi capelli,
di cotal grazia lâaltissimo lume
degnamente convien che sâincappelli.

Dunque, sanza mercÃ© di lor costume,
locati son per gradi differenti,
sol differendo nel primiero acume.

Bastavasi neâ secoli recenti
con lâinnocenza, per aver salute,
solamente la fede dâi parenti;

poi che le prime etadi fuor compiute,
convenne ai maschi a lâinnocenti penne
per circuncidere acquistar virtute;

ma poi che âl tempo de la grazia venne,
sanza battesmo perfetto di Cristo
tale innocenza lÃ  giÃ¹ si ritenne.

Riguarda omai ne la faccia che a Cristo
piÃ¹ si somiglia, chÃ© la sua chiarezza
sola ti puÃ² disporre a veder CristoÂ».

Io vidi sopra lei tanta allegrezza
piover, portata ne le menti sante
create a trasvolar per quella altezza,

che quantunque io avea visto davante,
di tanta ammirazion non mi sospese,
nÃ© mi mostrÃ² di Dio tanto sembiante;

e quello amor che primo lÃ¬ discese,
cantando âAve, Maria, gratÃ¯a plenaâ,
dinanzi a lei le sue ali distese.

Rispuose a la divina cantilena
da tutte parti la beata corte,
sÃ¬ châogne vista sen fÃ© piÃ¹ serena.

Â«O santo padre, che per me comporte
lâesser qua giÃ¹, lasciando il dolce loco
nel qual tu siedi per etterna sorte,

qual Ã¨ quellâ angel che con tanto gioco
guarda ne li occhi la nostra regina,
innamorato sÃ¬ che par di foco?Â».

CosÃ¬ ricorsi ancora a la dottrina
di colui châabbelliva di Maria,
come del sole stella mattutina.

Ed elli a me: Â«Baldezza e leggiadria
quantâ esser puote in angelo e in alma,
tutta Ã¨ in lui; e sÃ¬ volem che sia,

perchâ elli Ã¨ quelli che portÃ² la palma
giuso a Maria, quando âl Figliuol di Dio
carcar si volse de la nostra salma.

Ma vieni omai con li occhi sÃ¬ comâ io
andrÃ² parlando, e nota i gran patrici
di questo imperio giustissimo e pio.

Quei due che seggon lÃ  sÃ¹ piÃ¹ felici
per esser propinquissimi ad Agusta,
son dâesta rosa quasi due radici:

colui che da sinistra le sâaggiusta
Ã¨ il padre per lo cui ardito gusto
lâumana specie tanto amaro gusta;

dal destro vedi quel padre vetusto
di Santa Chiesa a cui Cristo le chiavi
raccomandÃ² di questo fior venusto.

E quei che vide tutti i tempi gravi,
pria che morisse, de la bella sposa
che sâacquistÃ² con la lancia e coi clavi,

siede lunghâ esso, e lungo lâaltro posa
quel duca sotto cui visse di manna
la gente ingrata, mobile e retrosa.

Di contrâ a Pietro vedi sedere Anna,
tanto contenta di mirar sua figlia,
che non move occhio per cantare osanna;

e contro al maggior padre di famiglia
siede Lucia, che mosse la tua donna
quando chinavi, a rovinar, le ciglia.

Ma perchÃ© âl tempo fugge che tâassonna,
qui farem punto, come buon sartore
che comâ elli ha del panno fa la gonna;

e drizzeremo li occhi al primo amore,
sÃ¬ che, guardando verso lui, penÃ¨tri
quantâ Ã¨ possibil per lo suo fulgore.

Veramente, ne forse tu tâarretri
movendo lâali tue, credendo oltrarti,
orando grazia conven che sâimpetri

grazia da quella che puote aiutarti;
e tu mi seguirai con lâaffezione,
sÃ¬ che dal dicer mio lo cor non partiÂ».

E cominciÃ² questa santa orazione:



Paradiso Â· Canto XXXIII


Â«Vergine Madre, figlia del tuo figlio,
umile e alta piÃ¹ che creatura,
termine fisso dâetterno consiglio,

tu seâ colei che lâumana natura
nobilitasti sÃ¬, che âl suo fattore
non disdegnÃ² di farsi sua fattura.

Nel ventre tuo si raccese lâamore,
per lo cui caldo ne lâetterna pace
cosÃ¬ Ã¨ germinato questo fiore.

Qui seâ a noi meridÃ¯ana face
di caritate, e giuso, intra â mortali,
seâ di speranza fontana vivace.

Donna, seâ tanto grande e tanto vali,
che qual vuol grazia e a te non ricorre,
sua disÃ¯anza vuol volar sanzâ ali.

La tua benignitÃ  non pur soccorre
a chi domanda, ma molte fÃ¯ate
liberamente al dimandar precorre.

In te misericordia, in te pietate,
in te magnificenza, in te sâaduna
quantunque in creatura Ã¨ di bontate.

Or questi, che da lâinfima lacuna
de lâuniverso infin qui ha vedute
le vite spiritali ad una ad una,

supplica a te, per grazia, di virtute
tanto, che possa con li occhi levarsi
piÃ¹ alto verso lâultima salute.

E io, che mai per mio veder non arsi
piÃ¹ châiâ fo per lo suo, tutti miei prieghi
ti porgo, e priego che non sieno scarsi,

perchÃ© tu ogne nube li disleghi
di sua mortalitÃ  coâ prieghi tuoi,
sÃ¬ che âl sommo piacer li si dispieghi.

Ancor ti priego, regina, che puoi
ciÃ² che tu vuoli, che conservi sani,
dopo tanto veder, li affetti suoi.

Vinca tua guardia i movimenti umani:
vedi Beatrice con quanti beati
per li miei prieghi ti chiudon le mani!Â».

Li occhi da Dio diletti e venerati,
fissi ne lâorator, ne dimostraro
quanto i devoti prieghi le son grati;

indi a lâetterno lume sâaddrizzaro,
nel qual non si dee creder che sâinvii
per creatura lâocchio tanto chiaro.

E io châal fine di tuttâ i disii
appropinquava, sÃ¬ comâ io dovea,
lâardor del desiderio in me finii.

Bernardo mâaccennava, e sorridea,
perchâ io guardassi suso; ma io era
giÃ  per me stesso tal qual ei volea:

chÃ© la mia vista, venendo sincera,
e piÃ¹ e piÃ¹ intrava per lo raggio
de lâalta luce che da sÃ© Ã¨ vera.

Da quinci innanzi il mio veder fu maggio
che âl parlar mostra, châa tal vista cede,
e cede la memoria a tanto oltraggio.

Qual Ã¨ colÃ¼i che sognando vede,
che dopo âl sogno la passione impressa
rimane, e lâaltro a la mente non riede,

cotal son io, chÃ© quasi tutta cessa
mia visÃ¯one, e ancor mi distilla
nel core il dolce che nacque da essa.

CosÃ¬ la neve al sol si disigilla;
cosÃ¬ al vento ne le foglie levi
si perdea la sentenza di Sibilla.

O somma luce che tanto ti levi
daâ concetti mortali, a la mia mente
ripresta un poco di quel che parevi,

e fa la lingua mia tanto possente,
châuna favilla sol de la tua gloria
possa lasciare a la futura gente;

chÃ©, per tornare alquanto a mia memoria
e per sonare un poco in questi versi,
piÃ¹ si conceperÃ  di tua vittoria.

Io credo, per lâacume châio soffersi
del vivo raggio, châiâ sarei smarrito,
se li occhi miei da lui fossero aversi.

Eâ mi ricorda châio fui piÃ¹ ardito
per questo a sostener, tanto châiâ giunsi
lâaspetto mio col valore infinito.

Oh abbondante grazia ondâ io presunsi
ficcar lo viso per la luce etterna,
tanto che la veduta vi consunsi!

Nel suo profondo vidi che sâinterna,
legato con amore in un volume,
ciÃ² che per lâuniverso si squaderna:

sustanze e accidenti e lor costume
quasi conflati insieme, per tal modo
che ciÃ² châiâ dico Ã¨ un semplice lume.

La forma universal di questo nodo
credo châiâ vidi, perchÃ© piÃ¹ di largo,
dicendo questo, mi sento châiâ godo.

Un punto solo mâÃ¨ maggior letargo
che venticinque secoli a la âmpresa
che fÃ© Nettuno ammirar lâombra dâArgo.

CosÃ¬ la mente mia, tutta sospesa,
mirava fissa, immobile e attenta,
e sempre di mirar faceasi accesa.

A quella luce cotal si diventa,
che volgersi da lei per altro aspetto
Ã¨ impossibil che mai si consenta;

perÃ² che âl ben, châÃ¨ del volere obietto,
tutto sâaccoglie in lei, e fuor di quella
Ã¨ defettivo ciÃ² châÃ¨ lÃ¬ perfetto.

Omai sarÃ  piÃ¹ corta mia favella,
pur a quel châio ricordo, che dâun fante
che bagni ancor la lingua a la mammella.

Non perchÃ© piÃ¹ châun semplice sembiante
fosse nel vivo lume châio mirava,
che tal Ã¨ sempre qual sâera davante;

ma per la vista che sâavvalorava
in me guardando, una sola parvenza,
mutandomâ io, a me si travagliava.

Ne la profonda e chiara sussistenza
de lâalto lume parvermi tre giri
di tre colori e dâuna contenenza;

e lâun da lâaltro come iri da iri
parea reflesso, e âl terzo parea foco
che quinci e quindi igualmente si spiri.

Oh quanto Ã¨ corto il dire e come fioco
al mio concetto! e questo, a quel châiâ vidi,
Ã¨ tanto, che non basta a dicer âpocoâ.

O luce etterna che sola in te sidi,
sola tâintendi, e da te intelletta
e intendente te ami e arridi!

Quella circulazion che sÃ¬ concetta
pareva in te come lume reflesso,
da li occhi miei alquanto circunspetta,

dentro da sÃ©, del suo colore stesso,
mi parve pinta de la nostra effige:
per che âl mio viso in lei tutto era messo.

Qual Ã¨ âl geomÃ¨tra che tutto sâaffige
per misurar lo cerchio, e non ritrova,
pensando, quel principio ondâ elli indige,

tal era io a quella vista nova:
veder voleva come si convenne
lâimago al cerchio e come vi sâindova;

ma non eran da ciÃ² le proprie penne:
se non che la mia mente fu percossa
da un fulgore in che sua voglia venne.

A lâalta fantasia qui mancÃ² possa;
ma giÃ  volgeva il mio disio e âl velle,
sÃ¬ come rota châigualmente Ã¨ mossa,

lâamor che move il sole e lâaltre stelle.
