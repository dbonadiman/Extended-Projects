Graphs
------

**Graph from links** - Create a program that will create a graph or network from a series of links.

**Eulerian Path** - Create a program which will take as an input a graph and output either a Eulerian path or a Eulerian cycle, or state that it is not possible.  A Eulerian Path starts at one node and traverses every edge of a graph  through every node and finishes at another node.  A Eulerian cycle is a eulerian Path that starts and finishes at the same node.

**Connected Graph** - Create a program which takes a graph as an input and outputs whether every node is connected or not.

**Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** - Create a program that finds the shortest path through a graph using its edges.
